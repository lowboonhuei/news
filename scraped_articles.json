Several councils have begun work on removing cladding from the tower blocks, but there was disquiet among some local authority leaders that the government would push the cost of emergency works, such as sprinkler systems, on to councils.\n\nJeremy Corbyn described the cladding issue as \u201ca nationwide threat\u201d and said the prime minister needed to \u201cget a grip and lead a national response\u201d.\n\n\u201cI urge the government to make sure all necessary support \u2013 including, crucially, financial support \u2013 is urgently made available to councils across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prime minister said the government was working with councils, including Camden, \u201cmaking sure that the resources are there to ensure that what is needed to keep people safe is done\u201d.\n\nAcross government, ministers have been ordered to look again at fire safety policies in their departments. An urgent rethink has been under way at the Department for Education, which had begun a consultation on official new draft guidance on fire safety in schools last year that was widely seen as a substantial watering down of safety requirements.\n\nFire safety experts, backed by senior MPs, expressed deep alarm over the past year at the plans and warned ministers repeatedly that they could have disastrous results.\n\nPart of the revised draft guidance \u2013 which the Observer has learned will now be dropped \u2013 removed the requirement that sprinklers be included in the design of new schools and stated, instead, that \u201cschool buildings do not need to be sprinkler protected to achieve a reasonable standard of life safety\u201d. It also said it \u201cno longer includes an expectation that most new school buildings will be fitted with them\u201d.\n\nIn a letter to schools minister Nick Gibb last August, London fire commissioner Ron Dobson said such changes could have \u201cpotentially devastating consequences\u201d. Gibb announced the consultation on changes in a parliamentary debate on fire safety the previous October. He said the number of fires in schools had declined and pointed out that \u201cincluding sprinklers in new school buildings would add between 2% and 6% to the cost of works\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shadow education minister Angela Rayner said parents want to know that schools are safe for our children. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian\n\nGibb, one of the main forces behind the government\u2019s academy and free schools programme, added: \u201cThe department\u2019s assessment is that the additional spending would significantly outweigh any relatively modest saving from preventing some damage to school buildings.\u201d\n\nIn the same debate, the Tory MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, David Amess, said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d that under the Tory government the proportion of new schools and academies fitted with sprinkler systems had already fallen from 70% (between 2007 and 2010, under Labour) to 35%. \u201cThat is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the draft guidelines were published, teaching unions and fire safety organisations protested again but formed the impression that ministers were not listening and that the consultation was a sham.\n\nLast week, in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, the revised draft guidance had been removed from the DfE website. Amid signs of panic, officials tried to insist that there had never been any intention to change policy.\n\nThe Observer now understands that the proposals in the new draft guidance are to be taken back to the drawing board and that any sections which might be seen as weakening safety requirements \u2013 including the new language suggesting sprinklers are unnecessary \u2013 will be struck out.\n\nA government source insisted: \u201cWhat we would like to stress is that what we do will be a strengthening of fire safety requirements, not any weakening of them.\u201d Asked if that meant a rethink on sprinklers in new schools, the source said: \u201cThat would be entirely fair.\u201d A DfE spokesman said: \u201cThere will be no change to the fire safety laws for schools or our determination to protect children\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nLast night, Amess said he would welcome a change of approach but added: \u201cWe will keep up the pressure until a policy that makes sprinklers mandatory in all new schools is announced. We will also insist that checks are carried out on all existing schools to make sure they are safe.\u201d\n\nShadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \u201cParents want to know that schools are safe for our children, and there are real questions for the government to answer. It would be completely unacceptable if they have attempted to water down safety requirements simply to make free schools cheaper or let developers make an easier profit.\u201d\n\nThe aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire continued to play out on Saturday as the government named six of 15 local authorities where tower blocks have failed safety tests.\n\nPortsmouth, Brent, Camden, Manchester, Plymouth and Hounslow had all sent samples of cladding for testing and were told on Friday that there was a risk they could catch fire.\n\nCamden decided on Friday night to evacuate about 650 households from the Chalcots estate in north London, but many were forced to spend the night in a local leisure centre, prompting anger and complaints from residents.\n\nNone of the other councils said yesterday that they would follow Camden\u2019s lead, although Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, said it was a \u201ccorrect decision\u201d. \u201cPublic safety is absolutely paramount, you cannot put a price on people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\n\nMany councils have taken emergency measures, including posting 24-hour patrols to keep watch on the affected tower blocks.\n\nWith many local authorities, including Sheffield, installing sprinkler systems, there is growing unease among some council leaders that they will end up footing a large part of the bill.\n\nJavid said it was too early to say what the total cost would be. \u201cIf [local authorities] also have an issue with financial resources, we have made it very clear: you get on with that work, but you come to government and we will work with you make sure you have the resources that you need, if you don\u2019t have resources.\u201d\n\nNick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle Council, said this fell short of a guarantee. \u201cGovt have just confirmed on @BBCBreakfast that, despite all their talk of help, councils will have to pay to install sprinklers in blocks,\u201d he tweeted. He called on the government to lift a cap limiting the amount councils can borrow in relation to housing."}, {"title": "China landslide: at least 15 dead and more than 100 feared buried", "published": "2017-06-24T18:58:09", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/24/china-landslide-sichuan-province-xinmo-people-feared-buried", "text": "Rescue operation is under way in Sichuan province after more than 40 homes in Xinmo village were engulfed by landslide\n\nAt least 15 people have been killed and about 100 are believed to be buried in the debris after a landslide in south-west China\u2019s Sichuan province.\n\nChinese state media announced on Saturday that more than 60 homes had been covered in mud and rubble as dawn broke in Xinmo, a remote village in north Sichuan.\n\n\n\nThe debris slid 800 metres (half a mile) down a steep slope to block a 2km stretch of river and 1.6km of road, according to the official state news agency, Xinhua.

It is also noteworthy that the city in the background of the poster is being devoured by tornadoes, which adds a characteristically apocalyptic touch to the ISIS propaganda, although it makes the helicopter hovering in the upper-left corner of the Photoshopped image a bit implausible.\n\nThis is not the first exhortation to vehicular jihad published by the Nashir News Agency, which exists mostly as a channel on the secure messaging platform Telegram. A few weeks ago, they published a message in both English and Arabic that said, \u201cKill the civilians of the Crusaders, run over them by vehicles, gain benefit from Ramadan.\u201d\n\nThis earlier poster was a much less polished bit of propaganda, accompanied only by clip art of a handgun, knife, and truck.

Given time with a playable slice at this year\u2019s E3, I was struck by two things. First, that the franchise felt largely unchanged in ways I had hoped to see it evolve. Second, the ways Origins has changed have pushed it toward the sort of Ubisoft open-world homogenization that has been creeping into all of their major franchises.\n\nThe setting for Origins, at least, is unique. Ancient Egypt isn\u2019t exactly well-worn territory for video games, and it\u2019s rendered in vivid, authentic detail here. Not since Ezio\u2019s Italy campaing has the world felt so distinct, its sense of adventure so immediate. If the franchise\u2019s sabbatical has provided anything, it\u2019s that it has been time for Ubisoft\u2019s artists to develop a truly transportive sense of environment. Much of this is due to the NPCs on display, both human and animal. They move and behave with more life than we\u2019ve ever seen from the urban sprawl in any previous setting, due primarily to the fact that they have been gifted with substantive artificial intelligence for the first time.\n\nRather than animated mannequins, the denizens of Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins\u2019 Egypt have their own routines, priorities, and interactions. It makes little difference to anyone running breakneck through the world, but for the determined explorer \u2014 and I am most certainly one \u2014 it breathes life into otherwise thoughtless navigation. We weren\u2019t able to see very much of that in our time-restricted demo, and many of the more interesting interactions on display smelled of pre-scripted events, but the possibilities give me hope for the wider game world.\n\nUnfortunately, the classic Assassin\u2019s Creed fantasy seems to have been thrown aside in favor \u2014 of all things \u2014 crafting. That Ubisoft gameplay time-sink staple from other series has been brought from afterthought to center stage to support the more RPG-like loot aspects of Origins. And while the prospect of a custom loadout seems like it would be a great fit for a game about building the perfect assassin, in practice, it looks a lot like more like Far Cry\u2018s oft-derided exercise in animal looting.\n\nSimilarly, a drone-equivalent hawk companion has been cribbed from Watch Dogs, complete with a UI that looks more like it was pulled from Transformers than the Nile. It\u2019s crucial to the same enemy marking system that we\u2019ve seen in both of the aforementioned franchises. Here, social media information has been replaced with levels and behaviors of NPCs. The information accomplishes two things: it robs the conflicts of any shred of remaining immersion, as floating health bars and level numbers above your foes; and it lets you know when you\u2019ve gotten in over your head.\n\nThat\u2019s because your skill in Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins matters much less than your progression. Your deadly grace through gameplay comes in a distant second to your relative level, and even the most mundane guardsman will handily end your life if his world area is leveled higher than you\u2019ve managed. Even driving a hidden blade through the skull of an unsuspecting target will result in little more than annoyance if you haven\u2019t gained enough experience and looted enough hippo hides to make sure your assassin\u2019s blade is\u2026 what? Extra sharp?\n\nThe Assassin\u2019s Creed series has always done at least one thing right.

However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\n\n( CNN ) \u2014 It's considered one of the world's most dangerous active volcanoes.\n\nJust 55 kilometers south of Manila, Taal Volcano has erupted 30 times since the 16th century, accounting for the deaths of more than 5,000 people.\n\nYet it's scaled daily by dozens of groups of laid-back tourists.\n\nPerhaps they're calmed by Taal's reputation as the smallest active volcano in the world -- it's just 311 meters tall -- a title that hints at peril yet makes Taal sound relatively unintimidating.\n\nOr maybe it's the fact that after eight eruptions in the 1960s and 1970s, Taal Volcano has not vented its fury since 1977.\n\nIt's also in an incredible location that defies belief.\n\nTaal Volcano sits on an island within a lake within an island, adjacent to the holiday town of Tagaytay, a popular getaway for Manila residents.\n\nReady to take the risk?\n\nAfter arriving in Tagaytay, the first step is to take an outrigger boat across the deep blue waters of Taal Lake to Volcano Island.\n\nThis 15-minute trip costs about $10 each way -- you can hire a boat yourself or join a group tour from Tagaytay. Once visitors arrive at the main jetty on Volcano Island they can choose whether to do a 30 to 40-minute hike up its slope or complete the ascent on horseback.\n\nA small tourism office next to the jetty offers a horse and guide for about $20 return, although there's wiggle room if you're a skilled barterer. Considering the high heat and humidity in Tagaytay throughout the whole year, riding a horse is an attractive option.\n\nI picked the biggest one I could find, mounted it and headed off from the office with my young Filipino guide Anna leading the way.\n\nDespite the rough, bumpy dirt path, which leads up to the volcano rim, it was an enchanting experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 7 Taal Volcano: Located about 30 minutes south of Manila, Taal Volcano sits within a lake within an island, adjacent to the holiday town of Tagaytay, a popular getaway for Manila residents. The smallest volcano in the world, at just 1,020 feet tall Taal attracts thousands of tourists every year.\n\nFor me it was, at least. My horse clearly didn't share my enjoyment, becoming increasingly skittish.\n\nAs other tourists overtook me on their relaxed steeds, my horse stopped to make prolonged noises of apparent anguish.\n\n\"I'm sorry but I think you're too big,\" Anna told me sheepishly.\n\nAt 197 centimeters tall and 126 kilograms in weight, I could only nod in agreement. After covering minimal ground during my five-minute horse ride, I set off on foot. Roughly half of the other tourists heading for the rim were also hiking.\n\nThe slope is relatively gentle, making it a fairly easy hike for people even with a low level of fitness.\n\nThere are also ready-made excuses to take a rest if you do lose your breath. The higher you climb, the more striking the views across the island and the crystalline waters of Taal Lake.\n\nHiking boots or running shoes are advised -- the dirt path is frequently uneven and unstable. There's also great value in hiring a guide to ascend with you, even if you're not riding a horse.\n\nAnna was fine company and provided much info about Taal Volcano's lethal history -- including the fact it once erupted for more than six months, back in 1754.\n\nA volcanic Russian doll\n\nAs I completed the final ascent to the rim I detected a pungent, chemical odor. It's hard not to feel alarmed when experts warn that acrid fumes or strong sulfuric scents are a pre-cursor to an eruption. Then at the rim I found a couple sitting on a bench eating ice cream, while a young family giggled as they hit golf balls into the crater.\n\nClearly, there was no cause for concern.\n\nThe volcano is only closed to visitors on the rare occasion that Filipino authorities upgrade it from an \"Alert Level 0\" to an \"Alert Level 1,\" which means there's no threat of imminent eruption but that the volcano is behaving abnormally.\n\nThese tourists were soaking in what, for many visitors, is the payoff of scaling the volcano -- sprawling views of the crater, its lake and beyond.\n\nIn the fading afternoon light, the waters of Crater Lake appeared to gently bubble in certain areas, while other patches were stained white by sulfur.\n\nAdventurous visitors can hike around the rim. There are two trails, both about a kilometer long, which head in opposite directions around the rim.\n\nLike the path up the mountain they're rugged so progress is slow. These paths are also narrow, with steep drops on one side, so caution is necessary. The steam, rising from the earth near sections of these paths, provides a reminder of the volcano's deadly power.\n\nWhat these trails also offer is a closer vantage of the small, volcanic Vulcan Point Island inside Crater Lake.\n\nTaal is like a volcano version of a Russian doll.\n\nTiny Vulcan Point Island sits inside Crater Lake, which sits inside the Taal Volcano, which is inside Taal Lake. All are contained within Taal Caldera, a massive volcanic crater created hundreds of thousands of years ago by a gigantic eruption.\n\nThis prehistoric tectonic activity spawned a chain of volcanoes on the western side of Luzon Island, the largest of the more than 7,000 islands in the Philippines.\n\nTaal Volcano may be the deadliest of them all. But it's been asleep for 40 years. So now is a good time to visit.\n\nGetting there\n\nBuses and minivans depart downtown Manila for Tagaytay at regular intervals each day.

There, Ordek spotted a police car and ran to tell the officers what had happened. The attackers followed, telling the police they were \"family men\" who had been lured into Ordek's home. They denied doing anything wrong.\n\nOrdek's version of events was dismissed by police on the spot, Ordek says. The officers threw Ordek and the men into their patrol car and drove to the police station. \"Don't even dare make a criminal complaint. I'll chop off your head, we'll kill you,\" one attacker said, according to Ordek.\n\nKemal Ordek, author, activist and director of the Red Umbrella Organization Sexual Health and Human Rights at the organization's headquarters in Ankara in April.\n\nLater that night, police released Ordek's attackers without explanation. Ankara police declined to comment by phone or text message, asking that CNN send its request by handwritten letter.\n\nAccording to Ordek's attorney, it was only after they filed a civil complaint, and sought legal representation that police launched a criminal investigation.\n\nFor the next year, Ordek says the attackers unleashed a campaign of intimidation against them. Ordek also claims that pressure was applied by police to drop the complaint.\n\nPolice arrested the attackers last November. They were ultimately convicted for their crimes and sentenced to seven and a half years each for looting. One of the attackers had faced 20 years in prison for aggravated sexual assault but his lawyer was able to get that charge dropped upon appeal.\n\nWhile the case gained support from human rights organizations and attention from the national media, Ordek's family disowned them.\n\n\"My father told me, 'you better get killed instead of being raped because this is against our honor,'\" Ordek said.\n\nPosters in support of transgender sex workers' rights cover the walls of the Red Umbrella Sexual health and Human Rights Association in Ankara.\n\nAlthough homosexuality has been legal in Turkey since 1923, Turkey has one of the worst records of human rights violations against LGBTI+ people in Europe, according to a 2016 report from the European Region of the International LGBTI Association. A separate 2016 report to the United Nations by Turkish LGBTI+ advocacy groups identified at least 41 hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people that resulted in death from 2010 to June 2014.\n\nOrdek survived the brutal attack, but many others haven't.\n\nIn 2009, Eda Yildirim, a transgender sex worker was decapitated and burned alive; her breast implants cut out of her before she was murdered. In 2015, another transgender sex worker died after being stabbed 200 times by a client. In 2016, a young transgender woman named Hande Kader, a prominent member of the LGBTI+ community, was raped and burned alive. Her killer has not been found. Even when identified, many of the murder suspects have not been prosecuted.\n\nMustafa Yeneroglu, the Chief of Turkey's Parliament's Human Rights Observation Commission, told CNN that he had personally researched some of these incidents, but described them as \"mostly individual cases\" that didn't point to abuse of the LGBTI+ community.\n\nHighlighting that the victims were sex workers, Yeneroglu said: \"It should be researched sociologically and psychologically why these people are found in a criminal situation ... like (roadside) prostitution.\"\n\nHomosexuality is a biological disorder, a disease ... something that needs to be treated. Selma Aliye Kavaf, former state minister for family affairs\n\nBut Ordek -- the director of the Red Umbrella Sexual Health and Human Rights Association, an NGO promoting health and rights for sex workers in Turkey -- says that according to their research, roughly 90% of the country's transgender people feel sex work is the only way they can make a living.\n\nBetul, a transgender woman who asked CNN to refer to her only by her first name for her safety, spent nearly ten years of her life trying to work a \"regular job\" after graduating from university but was repeatedly sexually assaulted.\n\nEventually Betul turned to sex work, but faced more violence than before. Last year, an organized crime gang attacked Betul in her home, nearly severing her hand from her wrist.\n\nAfter recovering from the attack, Betul pressed charges against her assailants, but the prosecutor assigned to her case was arrested shortly after, over his alleged ties to Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric in self-imposed exile who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of being behind a failed military coup to overthrow him in 2016.\n\nErdogan's rise\n\nLGBTI+ activists fear that the fight for justice will become even more difficult following Erdogan's referendum win in April which gives him sweeping new powers over the judiciary.\n\nBefore Erdogan became Prime Minister in 2003, he garnered support by giving a voice to minority groups, including the LGBTI+ community, declaring in 2002, \"homosexuals must also be given legal protection for their rights and freedoms.\" But two years later, Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) removed the phrase \"sexual orientation\" from a draft law, describing it as \"unnecessary.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Erdogan: What you need to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Erdogan: What you need to know 01:42\n\nAs Erdogan tightened his grip on power in the intervening years, activists say he and his government became more conservative, more Islamist and more homophobic.\n\nIn 2010, then former state minister for family affairs, Selma Aliye Kavaf told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, \"homosexuality is a biological disorder, a disease ... something that needs to be treated.\"\n\nIn 2013, Erdogan described homosexuality as a \"sexual preference\" that was incompatible with the \"culture of Islam\" in Turkey.\n\n'We're just passing days here'\n\nOn a quiet lane in central Ankara, Ordek sat with peers who had gathered to discuss their future in post-referendum Turkey.\n\nA lawyer, who asked for her identity to be concealed for her security, told CNN that Erdogan used the referendum campaign to usher in a new wave of homophobic hate speech, and said the President is fostering a culture of police hostility whipped up by his extreme rhetoric. Erdogan's press office did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment.\n\nHostility to the LGBTI+ community has also seeped into Turkey's pro-government news organizations. In the wake of the terror attack in Orlando in 2016, when 49 people were gunned down at a nightclub, popular among gay men, the headline in the far-right Yeni Akit paper read: \"50 perverts killed in bar.\"\n\nAnd in March, just one month before the referendum vote, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told the former editor of Hurriyet \"to go and hang with faggots in the US.\"\n\nAccording to a 2013 Pew Research Center Survey, 78% of Turkish people said they reject homosexuality. Today, the LGBTI+ community feels the government is unable or unwilling to prevent violence against them. Some say they fear that they will even be targeted by their own families. This has prompted an increasing number of people in the community to seek help, the lawyer said.\n\n\"If a family member decides to...kill you, they can because the government doesn't effectively investigate,\" she said. \"They turn their backs to these 'honor killings.'\"\n\nYeneroglu, the head of the Parliament's human rights commission, told CNN that the commission will be meeting with LGBTI+ organizations to follow up on their concerns, but he did not specify when.\n\nSerkan, 28. \"The government's perspective on gender studies has changed.\"\n\nSerkan, a gay 28-year-old PhD student from Istanbul who asked CNN not to publish his last name out of concerns for his safety, said his university has also become more intolerant as Erdogan has tightened his grip on power.\n\nSerkan and his university's gender studies department is \"almost non-existent.\" He says most of the academics in the department were fired following Turkey's post-coup crackdown, which has seen more than 110,000 people detained and almost 50,000 of them arrested.\n\n\"Since the purge started, the government's perspective on social science departments, specifically in gender studies, has changed,\" he told CNN. \"It was a hostile change.\"\n\nThis atmosphere of fear permeates all levels of society, according to Tolga, a 21-year-old office worker who came out as gay only four years ago. He asked for his last name to be withheld out of concerns for his safety.\n\nTolga, 21. \"I feel safe in the office, but not in general. We're just passing days here.\"\n\nAs he lists a number of political upheavals -- from the 2016 failed coup to a bloody fight against the resurgence of a Kurdish separatist movement in the south -- Tolga fears that the LGBTI+ community is increasingly becoming a scapegoat as President Erdogan seeks to consolidate power and eliminate all dissenting voices.\n\n\"When I go to sleep at night, I'm always worried about what will happen the next day,\" he said.\n\n\"Especially under the state of emergency [which was imposed in July 2016], everyone is feeling particularly concerned in their daily lives. I have started coming to work from a street that is safer than my usual route,\" Tolga told CNN.\n\nTolga fears that his way of life is being forced underground as Turkey's gay people lose public spaces where they can safely congregate. He cites the terrorist attack on a prestigious gay-friendly nightclub in Istanbul on New Year's Eve, and the state-ban on Ankara and Istanbul gay pride events last year.\n\n\"I fear I'm going to have to live a life where I meet with my friends in houses and in private -- I fear that socializing outside will stop,\" he said.\n\nHe also worries that Erdogan is pitting what many LGBTI+ people see his increasingly Islamist conservatism against the country's traditionally secular, urban society. \"The political situation changes in the country very rapidly, so I don't know what it's going to be like the next day,\" he said.\n\n\"I fear for civil war in this country.\"", "link": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/europe/turkey-homophobia-violence/index.html"}, {"published": "2017-05-31T00:00:00", "title": "Cape Town drought is worst in over a century", "text": "Story highlights Cape Town is in its worst drought in 100 years and the situation is likely to be a long-term problem\n\nCity residents have been asked to reduce water usage to 100 liters per day\n\n(CNN) The worst drought in a century is forcing the most stringent water restrictions ever implemented for South Africa's second largest city.\n\nCape Town has less than 10% of its useable water remaining for its nearly 4 million residents.\n\nThe city is implementing Level 4 water restrictions , which ask residents to limit daily usage to 100 liters (26 gallons) per person.
