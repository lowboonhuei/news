Recognising that the application of Industry 4.0 technologies can help us restructure our apparatus, digitalise business governance, and increase competitiveness, we are giving top priority to this initiative by building a comprehensive strategy on technology application for our businesses. To encourage Vietnam to take action and join Industry 4.0, the government should give priority to businesses to be at the centre of the national innovation ecosystem, develop the enabling government, and further improve the business climate. They should have policies to support businesses in improving technology capacity, to enable them to develop new and key products, and advanced technologies. It is also important to renovate the education and training systems to meet the development demands in the digital age. Jorge Martin-Martinez - General director DKSH Vietnam E-commerce, a crucial part of Vietnam\u2019s digital economy, has seen strong growth in terms of revenues and market scale, totaling around $4.6 billion.

Patrick Architta \u2013 Chairman K2 Management Vietnam Vietnam has vast potential and valuable natural resources, which represents an attractive open market for foreign investors. In the last five years, K2 Management has been involved in every step of numerous projects in the energy sector, from development and construction to asset management, and has a good insight into Vietnam\u2019s current market. For instance, the last feed-in tariff for wind electricity generation is inviting for both local and international financiers. With electricity demand growing 10 per cent a year, a bright future for wind projects is expected. It is also pleasing to note how accessible the market is for overseas investors, who can develop projects in Vietnam in collaboration with a mix of international companies, local contractors, and Vietnamese authorities. Regarding our involvement in the Dam Nai project, the first foreign-owned wind farm in Vietnam, we must highlight the hard work and skilled labour provided by our Vietnamese employees. K2 Management continues to be optimistic as a lot of improvements have been made in a short period of time. K2 Management believes that renewable projects in Vietnam are competitive and the company will maintain their support for better energy projects. Nguyen Manh Tuong - Managing director Wize Vietnam Wize Solutions recognises that Vietnam can be a hub of innovation and creativity and not just a place for implementation. We have always seen Vietnam as a highly inventive place, and we are committed to building our innovation hub here in Hanoi, expanding our space to accommodate growth. Our global team is thriving but the innovative software solutions that come from Vietnam are differentiating us in the market, and that is why it makes sense for us to invest more in this location. Pham Minh Tuan \u2013 CEO FPT Software Although Vietnam has implemented different programmes on digital transformation, and many provinces and cities have actively participated in this practice, it still needs to take more specific action. The decision makers on innovation should pay more attention and express more determination to carry out this process. They should find out how to start this course of action, with whom, and how to efficiently see it through. Technologies are just our tools for innovation, not magic wands. To ensure efficiency, business owners or unit leaders should be the direct captains of innovation programmes. In addition, there should be co-operation between ministries, industries, and localities with synchronous and comprehensive plans. As a software provider, FPT Software has built a methodology on digital transformation called FPT Digital Kaizen. This is a collection of the practical experiences of a big US group. Pham Duy Khuong - Managing director ASL Law Vietnam is now embracing digital transformation, a comprehensive change that opens up great opportunities. Digital transformation increases labour productivity by replacing manual labour with automation, replacing intellectual capital with data, and removing intermediate mechanisms in the value chain with direct connection tech. These factors will make Vietnam more attractive to overseas financiers when they are thinking about whom to back. It is time for Vietnam to selectively accept investment flows with better quality, good scale, modern technology, environmental protection, and legal compliance. Michael Sailer \u2013 CEO thyssenkrupp Vietnam In a 2016 World Bank report on Digital Dividends, Vietnam\u2019s Digital Adoption Index was scored at 0.46 on a scale of 0 to 1, above the global average of lower-middle income countries but below the average for the region. This could be a catalyst for Vietnam to push for further development of the ICT sector and enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness. There are encouraging signs in the government\u2019s strong and positive focus on Industry.

AI is one of the core technologies of Industry 4.0, having a strong impact on almost all fields of socio-economic life from production and product consumption to social management.\n\nTraffic problems, and urban planning of Vietnam and other countries are gradually being solved with the participation of AI. The leading technology corporations in Vietnam, such as VNPT and Viettel, are investing large resources in the development of such technology. The first AI tech products have been introduced and applied such as plate recognition in traffic, face recognition in the field of digital government, and in security and education.\n\nOverall, AI refers to not only technology but also a range of methods to demonstrate intelligent behaviours such as logic in solving problems. It has many benefits in data analysis, trend detection, creating future models, handling highly accurate jobs, and working in environments that are not suitable for humans. On the other hand, it also brings big risks related to cyber attacks, data protection, and transparency, as well as potential risks for people due to close surveillance.\n\nAI in transport\n\nAI is applied in developing driverless cars, managing traffic, ensuring security through face recognition, license plates, and many other applications.\n\nRoad transport is one of the industries that AI is most successfully applied, making transportation safer, quicker, and more convenient. The number of traffic accidents will be significantly reduced thanks to the minimisation of errors in human behaviour by replacement of unmanned vehicles, which are automatically controlled by AI.\n\nUnmanned cars rely on a variety of sensors such as GPS, cameras, radars, controllers, and software.\n\nCurrently, applying AI technologies for all driving functions are being tested, but it will be difficult because of the complexity of different factors such as the road system, transport infrastructure like signs and intersections, and the unpredictability of other vehicles travelling on roads.\n\nIn another application, AI technology combined with cameras and sensors attached along roads will collect and analyse traffic flow data, to issue warnings and control flows, contributing to reduction traffic congestion and thereby saving time for travellers, all while reducing pollution emissions to the urban environment.\n\nAI technologies will help traffic managers analyse traffic patterns, flows, and optimal roads.\n\nThey can provide drivers with information on the fastest and most open routes to reduce congestion. In addition, AI technologies can also help calculate and control traffic signals in real time to meet existing traffic flows.\n\nThis AI application is being invested in by Vietnam\u2019s leading technology corporations because it is very practical and there is a great demand from our country\u2019s cities. VNPT has used this application to deploy traffic camera systems to monitor security and control traffic, initially achieving some success across some urban areas of Vietnam.\n\nAI is also used in the aviation industry. Advances in automation and computing power, using technologies relevant to AI and analysing model data have been used to improve the management of increased air traffic volumes.\n\nAI can create optimal processes and tasks in the aviation industry such as checking engine safety, operating aircraft movement, and flight rotation factors such as refuelling, and loading and unloading.\n\nBesides that, AI helps uncover unwanted items going through airport security checks thanks to face recognition and big data processing to detect anomalies and prevent major incidents.\n\nFor other industries such as rail and sea transport, AI technologies have also had many applications in automation, transport process optimisation, routing optimisation, and creating economic values as well as improving service quality.\n\nUrban planning management\n\nAI technology has helped managers solve problems related to urban management, planning, and implementation. Application of such technology is applied in geographic analysis, prominent in the case of Ho Chi Minh City. AI processes the vast amount of image data collected from satellites and provides detailed analysis information and results.\n\nThis can clearly show the transformation of the city almost in real time, checking the development of the urban area based on the approved plan. In addition, the application of AI technology can perform classification of surfaces and land use according to space and time, thereby providing predictive analysis of future urban space use and support for urban planners.\n\nAI technology combined a network of sensors also assists the city in planning maintenance and improving the urban technical infrastructure network. Based on data collected by devices utilising the Internet of Things, the status of urban infrastructure will be updated in real time, warning the management unit in case repair or maintenance is needed.\n\nFor example, large potholes in the street can be determined by the data generated by vibration sensors. Thereby the city can capture the status and make suitable plans for repairs, avoiding traffic disruptions and accidents.\n\nThe strong development of smart mobile devices is also a huge source of data to help cities solve problems related to urban planning management. The city can work together with network operators to collect data on subscriber density in different time frames to be able to capture the population density in an area and give out analysis and forecasts supporting the planning of houses, along with other urban facilities and utilities.\n\nThus, with AI technology, cities will have an effective tool to manage urban planning and traffic, solve the problems of congestion in urban life, and help improve the quality of people\u2019s lives.\n\nIt will also help optimise and develop authorities\u2019 urban management capacity. AI technology will be the future of Vietnamese cities, helping them change the structure of society and upgrade the economy to a new level.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/ai-drives-urban-management-future-71236.html", "published": "2019-10-18T16:24:46+07:00"}, {"title": "Vietnam promotes trade, investment cooperation with Algeria\u2019s Constantine", "text": "The Vietnamese Embassy in Algeria works with Constantine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI).(Photo: VNA)\n\nDuring his stay on October 16-17, he had a working session with governor of Constantine Abdessamie Saidoun, during which they discussed measures to promote bilateral cooperation in various sectors on the basis on thriving relations between the two countries.\n\nThey expressed their interest in cooperating in agriculture, tourism and labour export.\n\nOn the occasion, the Vietnamese Embassy joined hands with the Constantine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI) to organise a forum on introducing import-export cooperation and investment potential.\n\nCCCI president Souici Larbi called Vietnamese businesses to enhance collaboration with local firms in agriculture, tourism and pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMany Constantine enterprises said they were interested in working with Vietnamese partners in the fields, while asking the Vietnamese authorities to create favourable conditions in legal procedures so that they can study and seek investment opportunities in the Southeast Asian nation.\n\nHighlighting sound cooperation between the two nations in the past time, Ambassador Tru stressed the Vietnamese Government and Embassy will give necessary support to Algerian businesses who want to boost cooperation and investment with Vietnamese companies in the fields of their strengths.\n\nOn October 17, Ambassador Tru and the working delegation from the Vietnamese Embassy met with several Algerian pharmaceutical businesses at the international fair and exhibition on pharmaceutical industry and cosmetics 2019 to enhance cooperation and trade exchange with the firms.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/vietnam-promotes-trade-investment-cooperation-with-algerias-constantine-71230.html", "published": "2019-10-18T11:47:41+07:00"}, {"title": "Spain looks into further investment in Vietnam", "text": "Spanish investors increasingly pay attention to Vietnam\n\nOver the past 42 years, Vietnam and Spain have inked diverse co-operation agreements and deals.

The two sides set the target to elevate trade turnover to more than $5 billion by 2020.\n\nRegarding development co-operation, Spain fosters comprehensive relations with Vietnam which received pledges of$300 million of Official Development Assistance (ODA) for bilateral and multilateral co-operation projects for over 10 years. Currently, Spain continues to bump up about $350 million for infrastructure development projects in Vietnam.\n\nIn a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in October 2018, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the Spanish government to encourage companies to gain ground in Vietnam and to sound out more business opportunities in the local market in the fields ofrenewable energy, hightechnology, education, infrastructure, and architecture.\n\nIn mid-August last year at the Vietnam-Spain Co-operation and Development Forum, Spanish Ambassador to Vietnam Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Figa Lopez-Palop emphasised that Vietnam is an important and long-term strategic partner of Spain.\n\nMany Spanish programmes and projects are effectively implemented across the provinces and cities of Vietnam.

With nearly 100 years of experience globally, Acciona can contribute our best-in-class expertise and practical solutions to the sectors of transport infrastructure, environment, and industry, where there are gaps currently. Vietnam is a key strategic market for Acciona. Therefore, we are actively seeking opportunities to work with local partners and the government,\u201d said Sim Hwee Ping.\n\nSpanish investors show interest in infrastructure and energy in Vietnam\n\nInfrastructure and energyare among the new trends of investment and co-operation pursuedby Spanish investors in Vietnam in the near future.\n\nAccording to Spanish Ambassador to Vietnam Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Figa Lopez-Palop, with the current growth momentum in Vietnam, there are two main areas where Spain has a lot of experience and can help Vietnam, namely infrastructure and energy.\n\nThe two countries have also strengthened co-operation in these areas. \u201cWe are looking forward to learning more about Vietnam's infrastructure and energy sectors so that we can develop co-operation in the future. Many Spanish businesses are preparing to bid for the construction and supply of airport facilities such as radar systems and airport traffic management in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nShe added Spain is considered one of the leading countries in the infrastructure field in Europe and Latin America. Meanwhile, in the field of energy, there is also the presence of Spanish businesses specialised in renewable energy. This is an extremely important field for every country in the world, and Spain thinks Vietnam shares the latter\u2019s interest.\n\nAcciona, as one of the biggest international contractors, can add value to these projects throughout his experience, expertise, and background. The company has a clear mission: help the country and the people of Vietnam to fight global warming and its effects with the latest technology and bring the best quality of life to the people here.\n\n\u201cWith the commitment to the environment and sustainability, Acciona is very optimistic when entering the Vietnamese market. We are confident that with nearly 100 years of experience all over the world, we will bring the most advanced technology with European standards to Vietnam,\u201d said Ruben Camba, Infrastructure director of Acciona in Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe presence of Acciona in Vietnam is considered to expand foreign co-operation and investment in Vietnam and is a big step forward to call for other Spanish businesses to explore the country\u2019s potentials.\n\nThe company aims to become a long-term partner in Vietnam, working towards the development of sustainable infrastructure projects, with a focus on the procurement of water and transport infrastructure to benefit present and future generations.\n\nCamba said that in the coming years, Acciona will work closely with Vietnamese partners to join in other infrastructure projects, which is the strength of this Spanish construction group, such as bridges, airports, metro, ports, hospitals, renewable energy plants, and water plants.\n\nCamba also shared that the world generates more than 2 billion tonnes of waste every year, but only 20per cent of them can be recycled \u2013 and this amount of waste is expected to grow with the population every year.\n\nIn Asian countries like China, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, and India, the amount of waste could more than double to over 600 million tonnes between 2015 and 2025.\n\nIn order to effectively solve the garbage disposed in the environment, Acciona has built waste-to-energy facilities to generate electricity for households in many countries. Currently, Acciona is building such a facilityin the UK, the first thermal utility-scale waste-to-energy facility in Australia, and has completed many similar plants in Spain.\n\nThe Australia-based plant that Acciona is building can process 400,000 tonnes of waste per year and generate 36MW of electricity, enough to power50,000 households,\u201d he added.\n\nFurthermore, Acciona also produces electricity from clean energy sources such as solar and wind.

Out of all of the company\u2019s operations, which include hotels, restaurants, villa management, and others, the casino was the only division to report profit according to the company\u2019s latest statement.\n\nVietnam has seven casinos that are open exclusively for foreigners. Many other facilities that retain the ban on locals have reported falling revenues in recent years.\n\nIn an annual report and audited accounts dated September, Donaco International Co., Ltd., which owns 95 per cent of Aristo International Hotel (formerly Lao Cai International Hotel JSC), said that game revenue in Vietnam fell by 16.6 per cent on-year, to $21.58 million in the fiscal year to the end of September. Aristo has 400 rooms and is only open for foreigners to gamble.\n\nMeanwhile, Royal International Corporation (RIC) which runs the only casino in Halong Bay, said that game revenue fell to VND19.52 billion ($848,700) in the first six months of this year in comparison to the VND81.45 billion ($3.54 million) last year. In 2017, RIC reported losses of VND127.5 billion ($5.79 million).\n\nSlowing visitor numbers have been blamed in part by the wide-scale opening of casinos in the region, while the market share was torn down as regulations failed to allow Vietnamese people to participate.\n\nCorona Resort and Casino\u2019s results have brought hope for other developers and are a step forward for the government to offer more trial programmes, then decide after three years whether to expand and continue.\n\nPositive regulation and big bet\n\nThe Ministry of Finance (MoF) is currently revising Decree 03 on gambling and the casino business to cut a number of investment conditions as well as calculating the minimum capital an interested investor must allocate before being granted a certificate for such development projects.\n\nUnder the decree, investment in any casino project has to be at least $2 billion. The MoF aims to keep minimum capital at $2 billion, but may allow investors to make further investments in the economic zone.\n\nIf approved, the revised decree could encourage investment into casino resorts and infrastructure projects connected to the country\u2019s special administrative-economic zones and see a boon for investors implementing registered projects.\n\nIn a recent interview with VIR, Hoiana chief operating officer Steve Wolstenholme said, \u201cGiven their size, these types of resorts are a boost to local employment as they require a diverse range of employees, often investing in training and personal development programmes for local residents.\u201d\n\nHowever, the MoF\u2019s proposal has been criticised by international financiers. Casino expert Augustine Ha Ton Vinh told VIR that adjustments are necessary; however, the limited scope of application does not meet the government\u2019s strategy requirements. \u201cTherefore, the adjustment must be more universal, with equal effects on investors of other current and future complexes,\u201d Vinh suggested.\n\nCurrently some casino in works in waiting a pilot to allow local resident to gamble.

But his ambition has become infeasible.\n\nVinh explained in some other countries, major casino developers have built and operated well-known casinos in property complexes, which are not casino only, but combined with many other facilities such as conferences hall, hotel rooms, restaurants and other leisure facilities. Those complexes are operating very successfully and the governments of those countries bring profits got from casino to invest back on public facilities served for the whole society. However, those casino are located in the downtown area of major cities. Meanwhile, the government of Vietnam has allowed some casinos but in remote areas, thus not attracting foreign investors.

Thereby, 95 per cent of total customs revenue flows in via bank transfer, while 99 per cent of businesses register to pay taxes online.\n\nTo date, there are 32 units licensed by the SBV, 28 of which provide payment portal services and 29 of which provide e-wallet services. \u201cMoney transfers via mobile banking have already surpassed ATMs,\u201d a representative of the SBV emphasised.\n\nIn fact, the number of internet and mobile banking transactions was 204 and 170 million in the second quarter of this year, rising by 60.6 and 109.5 per cent over the same period last year, and the value of transactions also increased remarkably.\n\n\u201cMobile payment is a trend that supports new technologies like QR code, near field communication (NFC), tokenisation, and biometric authentication,\u201d added Dung from the SBV.\n\nOpenWay Group's board of directors\n\nAs the first-ranking digital payment processing software by Gartner for almost ten years now and the leader in digital wallet software by Ovum in the last three years, OpenWay is the best choice for banks and financial organisations to provide card and digital payment solutions.\n\nThe WAY4 application developed by OpenWay has been applied by 135 banks, financial organisations, and payment intermediaries, switching companies, as well as telcos across Asia, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nIn Vietnam, 14 banks and financial organisations have already set up WAY4, including ACB, Military Bank, VP Bank, MSB, Seabank, Bao Viet Bank, PG Bank, HD Bank, and SmartPay (FE Credit), Lotte Finance Vietnam, and ACS Vietnam (A-EON).\n\n\u201cThe digital payment ecosystem based on modern software and applications for card and other payments enables customers to exercise transactions in only half a minute, which is very comfortable and safe.

In the next ten years, Dam said, the country aims to grow by more than 7 per cent annually.\n\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung added that the impacts of becoming a global financial centre must be shared with the entire country.\n\n\u201cWith its great geographical location of Vietnam, its economic flagship Ho Chi Minh City is well-positioned to develop into a global financial centre,\u201d Dung added.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung, Ho Chi Minh City Party Secretary Nguyen Thien Nhan, and Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee Chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong at the forum\n\nSetting up a global financial centre is not only a modern economic trend, but also a proof of an active nation which is ready to develop and integrate with the globe, he added.\n\nWhile the global financial centre is still under construction, Dung boasted that its institution system will be more competitive than other markets in the region.\n\nVietnam has many advantages to develop Ho Chi Minh City into a global financial centre, including stable GDP, strong foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, as well as the government and local authorities' efforts to renovate and improve the business environment.\n\nAccording to Dung, the key factors that make Ho Chi Minh City especially suitable to become a global financial centre are a competitive market, qualified human resources, standard infrastructure system, and good foundation for financial services.\n\nMoreover, Vietnam is in a time zone different from the 21 biggest financial centres in the world. This is an opportunity for Ho Chi Minh City because investors can do business in Ho Chi Minh City even when other financial centres are closed.\n\nIn addition, Ho Chi Minh City is now conveniently accessible from other regional financial centres. Its Tan Son Nhat airport now serves flights to 72 cities of 25 countries.\n\n\u201cWith the determination and support from the government and local authorities, the business community, and international organisations, we believe that in the near future, the idea of having a global financial centre in Ho Chi Minh City will be realised,\u201d Dung said.\n\nAccording to doctor Tran Du Lich, member of the Prime Minister\u2019s economic advisory group, during the last 20 years, Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s authorities have been focusing on the development of the financial market. In reality, however, development has not been as fast as expected, therefore the city will still need a long time to become a global financial centre.\n\n\u201cTurning this potential, advantages, and ambition into reality is a big issue not only for Ho Chi Minh City but for the whole country as well,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, there is always a first step to starting this long journey.

The leading ride-hailing platform in Southeast Asia, Grab, owned no vehicles; the world\u2019s most popular media company, Facebook, boasted no content; and the world\u2019s largest accommodation provider, Airbnb, owned no property. From nothing to multibillionaires, those audacious entrepreneurs have changed the consumption and social habits of billions of people around the world. Something big is going on, and this is thanks to the sharing economy.\n\nThe sharing economy relies on the concept of shared use of community resources and technology to build business models. Startup companies, which take the business initiative, own no factories or warehouses, yet mobilise the resources of global users. Modern technology minimises costs of operating services and anticipates customer needs. There are more than 9,500 global companies operating under this model, helping millions of people to rent rooms, lease offices, get a business loan, and share houses, cars, bicycles, clothes, skills, Wi-Fi, and so on.\n\nNguyen Thi Tue Anh, deputy director of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, said, \u201cThe nature of the sharing economy is a new business model which takes advantage of digital technologies, thus reducing transaction costs and accessing a large number of customers through the digital foundation. Compared with the traditional economic model, the sharing economy is the heart in digital spaces.\u201d\n\nThe sharing economy has become a consumption trend, opening a new future for global business opportunities, including in Vietnam. As a result, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on August 12, 2019 enacted Decision No.999/QD-TTg approving the Project on Promoting the Sharing Economic Model.\n\nThe project encourages innovation, and the application and development of the digital economy. It puts businesses at the centre of the digital process innovative, supports domestic tech companies, and adapts to the new development trend of the shared economic model in the context of the rapid global development of digital technology.\n\nIt can be seen that the government has lit the green light for the initiative to help enterprises take advantage of the sharing economy, minimise the legal risk, and ensure the responsibilities and benefits of parties that participate in the sharing economy model.\n\nPlatform power startups\n\nVietnam is one of the world\u2019s hottest startup hubs. The region\u2019s startup ecosystem is to receive a combined $425 million from 18 venture capital funds, including many big names like Golden Gate Ventures, 500 Startups, and Topica over the next three years, according to the Vietnam Ventures Summit.\n\nIn July 2018, Grab launched Grab Ventures, a major programme aiming to assist startups in various fields such as mobility, food, logistics, and financial services. Grab Ventures allows a new approach to Grab\u2019s tremendous customer base, and mentorship and access to Grab\u2019s technological assets for startups to test their services via Grab\u2019s ecosystem. This applies not only for mobility, food delivery, and parcel delivery, but also digital payments.\n\nThere are more and more resources out there to support startups. If young startups take advantage of the sharing economy efficiently, it will help them overcome challenges, creating a boom for ambitious business projects.\n\nCrowdfunding platforms from the community such as KickStarter, Indiegogo, RocketHub, and FundRazr have become more common. Individuals post their creative projects on these platforms to seek funding from the community. In addition, peer-to-peer lending platforms also supports funding for small businesses with attractive interest rates.\n\nThe bartering model between businesses also brings out the practical benefits. Businesses with assets, excess machinery, unutilised warehouses, and inventory can be exchanged together for mutual benefit, while saving time for money transfer.\n\nThe sharing economy is not a one-for-all solution, yet it opens up new doors and guides young businesses through the many obstacles ahead.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/a-sharing-economy-for-new-startups-71237.html", "published": "2019-10-18T16:29:44+07:00"}, {"title": "Seeking success where Amazon failed", "text": "Seeking success where Amazon failed\n\nPresent in the local market for several years now under the intermediate online shopping website fado.vn operated by Fado Vietnam JSC, the US e-commerce platform Amazon has completely faded into the background behind many platforms in Vietnam.\n\nAccording to the latest report from iPrice Group, the owner of a meta-search website allowing users to compare prices and products at several e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, fado.vn has never made it among the top 10 most popular e-commerce platforms in Vietnam in its five years of operation. The most popular platforms in Vietnam include tiki.vn, shopee.vn, lazada.vn, and sendo.vn.\n\nThe low rank of fado.vn makes it a questionable choice for Alibaba, which in March officially entered into co-operation with Fado to become an authorised global channel partner specialised in supporting local companies selling goods on the Chinese platform.\n\nThe impacts of the US-China trade war are becoming graver, with the US administration considering delisting Chinese companies \u2013 including Alibaba \u2013 from its stock exchanges, a move that will limit US investment in Chinese companies. In the same afternoon as the news made headlines on September 28, Alibaba\u2019s stock fell by up to 7 per cent. The increasing tension and its much-reduced prospects in the US may be the reason behind the Chinese e-commerce platform boosting investment in Southeast Asia with Vietnam being the next step in this strategy.\n\nAfter nearly seven months of co-operation, Alibaba in late September announced plans to enter Vietnam under its own platform in the country. The move has led to concerns about Alibaba\u2019s ability to compete with other players in the increasingly congested Vietnamese market where e-commerce platforms are bogged down in a war of attrition in the hope that the rivals will throw in the towel first.\n\nThe deal with Fado took place as Lazada \u2013 in which Alibaba holds a controlling stake of 83 per cent \u2013 fell behind in the market, losing its crown to Shopee in 2018. Thus, its plan of opening an official branch in Vietnam may divide focus that was on Lazada.\n\nCareful moves\n\nAlibaba said it will initially focus on three kinds of goods in Vietnam: garments, food, and wood products. The Chinese giant lauded Vietnam\u2019s advantages in quality and price of goods over regional countries. However, it claimed the lion\u2019s share of local companies operating on e-commerce platforms are not very knowledgeable about export-import activities, which makes the market ripe for the entry of Alibaba.\n\nFocusing on these three kinds of goods is a strategic move as overseas players like Shopee and Lazada are targeting electronic goods like smartphones, televisions, and laptops.\n\nIn an interview with VIR, Tran Hai Linh, CEO of Sen Do Technology JSC was of the opinion that this focus on gadgets is inappropriate for Vietnam. \u201cOverseas platforms have a big advantage in capital but they have little knowledge about the market itself. That is the reason why they focus on goods only suiting urbanites,\u201d said Linh.\n\nAssessing the move of Alibaba, the CEO of Sen Do confidently said that to survive in the battlefield, local companies should only focus on what customers find the best solutions, on offering the lowest price, and most importantly, on ensuring that their services meet the real demand. \u201cWe are Vietnamese and we know the Vietnamese market. We have a definite advantage in offering the best services for local customers,\u201d Linh said.\n\nIndeed, Sen Do is targeting similar goods categories because its main customer base is people living in rural areas \u2013 a grossly underrepresented group that makes up the majority of the population. Similar to other overseas platforms, rural markets are completely missing from Alibaba\u2019s entry plans. \u201cThis is a large gap in their market research,\u201d stated Linh.\n\nSpecifically, the countryside currently occupies about 70 per cent of the local market and consumers in the area have little demand for high-end products, preferring clothes and household \u00adappliances. \u201cMost overseas platforms ignore rural areas despite it being the main market here,\u201d Linh added.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s chosen goods categories are no real novelty: the segment is already occupied by Sendo, a group that prides itself on its knowledge of local demand and would be a tough competitor without a distinctive edge.\n\nOn the other hand, a battle with Shopee \u2013 the only overseas competitor in Vietnam \u2013 would also be fought uphill by Alibaba as the Singaporean firm, with its strong grasp on the market, is performing strongly in meeting the shopping demands of local city-dwellers.\n\nHuge losses in e-commerce\n\nAfter entry, Alibaba may have to accept huge losses in order to enhance its position. In fact, its e-commerce platform Lazada has been suffering dozens of millions of US dollars in losses. Due to the fierce competition, Lazada\u2019s losses in 2017 alone were estimated at VND1 trillion ($43.4 million).\n\nIn the 2015-2018 period, the total accumulated losses of the three giants \u2013 Lazada, Tiki, and Shopee \u2013 were VND9.4 trillion ($408.7 million). According to the latest statistics of securities company VNDIRECT, e-commerce companies would suffer a loss of VND124 billion ($5.4 million) to gain a single per cent of market share from rivals.\n\nIndeed, Alibaba\u2019s closest competitor-to-be in Vietnam, Sen Do, has also been suffering heavy losses. As of the end of 2016, the local platform recorded VND230 billion ($10 million) in accumulated losses. Linh said that losses are unavoidable in e-commerce.\n\n\u201cSen Do could turn a profit next year, but for that we would need to stop investing in the market, while there is plenty of room for development in the next 10 years,\u201d he explained.\n\nDespite being one of the fastest-growing sectors (30 per cent in 2018), according to the Vietnam E-commerce Association, the e-commerce sector is still new to the country, so businesses have to pour tremendous amounts of capital into advertisements, personnel, and warehouse infrastructure to set a solid foothold in the market.\n\n\u201cInvestors need to be in it for the next two or three decades to start seeing returns,\u201d said Linh\n\nThe moves of giants like Alibaba always send tremors through the markets, and similar to the shakeup Amazon\u2019s entry brought, the Vietnamese e-commerce market is buzzing like a hornet\u2019s nest with the news. However, it is necessary now to wait and see whether Alibaba can show something new.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/seeking-success-where-amazon-failed-71243.html", "published": "2019-10-19T13:00:08+07:00"}, {"title": "Authentic touch to local spice market", "text": "Mr. Cook has cooked up a plan to take on the most popular competitors, even Masan (Photo: Le Toan)\n\nThe launching ceremony of the Mr. Cook (Ong Bep) brand of condiments in Hanoi was sizzling with excitement from the more than 300 attendees, most of whom were housewives looking to try the \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d nutrition products that have already conquered most southern provinces and are making serious headways in overseas markets like Japan and Europe.\n\nTo start its conquest of the northern provinces on a high note, each participant was presented with a gift bag of 10 Mr. Cook spice and seasoning products by Nguyen Huynh Dat personally.\n\nAs the creator of leading multinationals of the spice world like Knorr (Unilever) and Maggi (Nestl\u00e9) for the Vietnamese market for more than 20 years, Nguyen Huynh Dat, CEO of Vietnam-Japan Food Industries JSC \u2013 Mr. Cook\u2019s brand owner, was confident that customers would straightaway see the difference between Mr. Cook\u2019s naturally fermented soybean soy sauce and spice products and currently popular condiments, especially as these products were made specifically for Vietnamese cuisine and local palates from clean raw materials meeting VIETGAP and organic standards in the country.\n\n\u201cThere are two ways to produce food, spice, and seasoning: food science technology and food nutrition \u2013 and Mr. Cook is the only brand that opted for the former,\u201d Dat said and expressed his desire of developing a domestic spice and seasoning brand for the almost 97 million Vietnamese people who are currently using condiments by domestic leading player Masan Consumer, or foreign producers like the Netherland\u2019s Unilever, Switzerland-based Nestl\u00e9, or Japan\u2019s Ajinomoto.\n\nFierce competition\n\nThe market for spices and seasoning is dominated by foreign players. According to Kantar Worldpanel, a global data, insights, and consulting company, in the four cities of Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Danang, and Can Tho as well as the rural regions, Masan Consumer has acquired the largest market share. The runner-up is Ajinomoto with a variety of soy products and fish sauces, as well as tomato and chilli sauce. In addition, Unilever and Nestl\u00e9 are also widely popular, although their market shares are significantly smaller.\n\nBesides, Nielsen, another consumer research services provider, forecasts the Vietnamese condiments market to reach an average annual growth of 25-32 per cent in 2016-2022. Vietnamese households pose a high demand for seasoning for their meals \u2013 and it does take a lot of seasoning to make 30 million litres of soup a day, all the while the amount of fried and stir-fried dishes increases by 18 million plates and 14 million braised dishes during the weekends.\n\nThe market potential is quite clear, which comes with fierce competition, forcing players to go all out \u2013 and like with many other segments, financial capacity is a key factor in deciding the winner.\n\nA good example would be monosodium glutamate (MSG), which makes up 30 per cent of the raw materials used to manufacture seasoning. Ajinomoto \u2013 which is a leading MSG manufacturer \u2013 has a definite advantage in this segment, which allows it to market Aji-ngon products at a lower pricing point than Unilever\u2019s Knorr.\n\nBesides, Ajinomoto also owns bone and meat broth extraction technology and does not have to use processed chicken flour like Knorr, which brings its overall material expenses even lower below the competition while ensuring higher quality ingredients.\n\nKnorr uses its financial potential to offset this disadvantage. Notably, when Aji-ngon issued the promotion programme of attaching stainless steel spoons worth VND4,000 (17 US cents) to each 200-gramme seasoning package, Knorr came out with a more attractive promotion, gifting plastic food containers worth VND15,000 (65 US cents) with a two-pack of seasoning with the total weight of 900 grammes. These competing marketing programmes are becoming a commonplace in the market, with supermarket shelves usually sporting a wide selection of condiments paired with different gifts.\n\nTo streamline manufacturing expenses, producers have even been changing packaging materials to pump their savings into promotion and marketing campaigns.\n\nVu Thi Thu Dung, senior account manager of Kantar Worldpanel, said, \u201cThe advantages of foreign producers are that they have conducted thorough research and acquired a deep understanding about the demand, habits, and taste of Vietnamese people. In addition, they have a tried and tested method of approaching their target customers to convince them to buy. Another advantage is financial potential, which allows them to launch massive promotion and advertisement programmes.\u201d\n\nNiche market for a smaller brand\n\nSeeing the state of the local market, Dat determined to create production lines and a factory where he could build on his dozens of years of experience at giant brands to mix spices for the local people.\n\nAt present, 90 per cent of total Mr. Cook\u2019s products are exported, while only 10 per cent finds its way to the domestic market via muahangviet.vn that serves the millions of workers in the industrial cluster of the whole southern area. Around 500,000 combos (consisting of 10 products) are sold every month.\n\nMr. Cook\u2019s products maintain traditional Vietnamese flavours. For example, his Phu Quoc anchovy sauce is made from real anchovies, following the traditional, natural brewing method while soy sauce is made from naturally fermented soybean. This results in a more authentic taste profile and brings the health benefits of organic products and traditional cuisine. However, these methods are less cost efficient and produce less in terms of output, which means Mr. Cook cannot compete directly with giants.\n\n\u201cIt would cost about 25 per cent of the price of our products to sell them in a supermarket, while we work with only 40 per cent profit margin, which is only half of the margin of foreign players. If we went into the expense of these retail channels, we would have nothing left for our long-term development plans,\u201d said Dat.\n\nThe Vietnamese brand has an ambitious expansion plan, nevertheless. They are planning to enter into co-operation with individual investors looking to set up small-scale restaurants and stores by providing about 90 per cent of the upfront costs of setup, procurement, and training, calculated somewhere between VND100-200 million ($4,350-8,700) as well as free WiFi and management software.\n\nIn order to boost distribution, Mr. Cook has entered into a collaborattion with Intelligent Investment and Management Co., Ltd. (IIM), Mr. Cook\u2019s products can approach customers without the need for massive expenditures for promotion and advertisement programmes. Moreover, IIM and Mr. Cook will take advantage of each other to popularise the products. Notably, Mr. Cook has good products but they lack the financial potential to display products in large supermarkets or implement marketing strategies to compete with foreign manufacturers\u2019 products. Another interesting channel will be household stores that can be opened from as little as VND5 million ($220).\n\nHowever, IIM owns the requisite technology base, the professional human resources, and potential investment investor network to help Mr. Cook deal with the distribution segment. The two parties have made an effort to distribute products with real quality, instead of striving to convince customers with ornate words and promises. However, the largest hurdle is local customers\u2019 psychological preference for foreign goods and famous brands, underpinned by headlining marketing campaigns that keep small brands from entering.\n\nTherefore, a niche market is a reasonable point of entry for Mr. Cook, where it can directly distribute to restaurants, hotels, and rural areas.\n\nFamous brands usually miss out on rural areas with low-income customers, and Mr. Cook has been filling in the gaps and received a warm welcome for its affordability, eye-catching packaging, and authentic taste profile.\n\nBesides, every Mr. Cook product is applied blockchain CSE3.0 technology to help consumers trace the origin of products.\n\nRevealing the marketing strategy of Mr. Cook, Le Van Thu, CEO of IIM, said, \u201cGifting our products to customers is one of the strategies our CEO thought up. This helps consumers to get a hands-on experience of the products and to discover their authentic value and health benefits for themselves and their families. It will be them coming to us for more.\u201d", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/authentic-touch-to-local-spice-market-71242.html", "published": "2019-10-19T09:00:09+07:00"}, {"title": "15+ Top CEOs converge to harness new future of HR", "text": "C-suite speaker lineup at Vietnam HR Awards Forum 2019\n\nHosted by Talentnet Corporation in association with the Newspaper of Labor & Social Affairs, Vietnam HR Awards Forum 2019 brings together the largest gathering of CEOs discussing strategic human capital insights for tomorrow, shedding new light on the collaboration between business strategy and people management.

The delegations at the conference provided an update on the current situation and offered their opinions about the regulatory system.\n\nThe conference is organised to evaluate Vietnam's new position attained through its active participation in international trade agreements which necessitate the reviewing and amendment of many legal documents. This requires the quality of legal documents to be improved to make sure newly issued documents will not have to be amended after they are found unfeasible or contradictory to other documents. It will also have to be made sure that they do not create new legal barriers for businesses, or negatively affect economic development.\n\nTheLaw on Promulgation of Legislative Documents provides clear regulations on transparency and consulting relevant stakeholders in the process of drafting legal documents. However, there are several legal documents drafted and issued in a way that is not in accordance with these tenets or without making a comprehensive assessment of socio-economic impacts.\n\nMark Gillin, head of VBF's Tax and Customs Working Group, shared international experience\n\nAccording to Dau Anh Tuan, head of the legal department of the VCCI, reasonableness, consistency, feasibility, and transparency are vital to the quality of legal documents. In the upcoming time, new legislative solutions should remove non-transparent regulations, continue to reduce barriers to market entry, protect the freedom of businesses, fight against group interests and overlapping laws, enhance sincerity, and consult businesses and individuals. In particular, the shortened drafting process should not be applied to influential laws such as tax laws to ensure that all relevant stakeholders groups are involved.\u201d\n\nDuring the workshop, leading economic and policy experts assessed the stability of business legislation as well as the challenges to policymakers in the context of economic integration. The experts also highlighted the necessity of collecting the opinions of associations and businesses to assess the quality and feasibility of the current business legislation documents.\n\nSharing international experiences during the process of building legal documents, Mark Gillin, head of VBF's Tax and Customs Working Group, said that the most important thing is that policymakers need to determine specific targets when they build documents. Besides, they need to determine the relevant objects affected by the law while simultaneously ensuring their involvementuntil the document is completed. Furthermore, they must have a deep understanding about the impacts of the policy on relevant parties in order to make sure the policy does not only serve one or a few groups while causing risk and damage to others.\n\n\u201cThe relevant groups are not only enterprises in the industrial sector, but also enterprises specialising in supply chain and supporting industries. They need to be considered by policymakers for the best solution for parties,\u201d Mark Gillin said.\n\nAn example about the impacts of tax regulation on both manufacturers and supporting enterprises, the survey implemented by the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) showed that if the authorities apply a special consumption tax on soft drinks, it would impact customers, beverage manufacturers, and the relating 21 auxiliary industry sectors, as well as the GDP of the country.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Anh Tuan concluded that sincerity and transparency are essential during the drafting process of legal documents to ensure the participation and involvement of all citizens and businesses, the use of fast-track drafting process should be minimised. In addition, Tuan also emphasised the essentiality of conducting the socio-economic impact assessment of the new legal documents and policies before issuance to avoid any unexpected consequences.\n\nThe forum gathered different opinions and comments, notably the practical experiences from domestic and foreign associations and business communities.

There, KCP was greatly assisted by the leaders of Phu Yen in the process of zoning growing areas, building relationships with local farmers, raising sugar factories\u2019 capacity, and expanding operation.\n\nSince then, KCP has grown sustainably, expanding the capacity of Son Hoa Sugar Plant to 10,000 tonnes of sugarcane per day, as well as having put into operation a 30MW biomass power plant since 2017.\n\nBesides that, KCP also raised the capacity of its Dong Xuan Sugar Factory to 1,000 tonnes of sugarcane per day. The company\u2019s total investment value until has now reached $103 million.\n\nAccording to Subbaiah, Phu Yen is not only rich in natural resources, with a mild \u00adclimate, and conducive environment for investment, but the leaders of the province are also willingly accompanying enterprises, creating favourable conditions for investors in production and business activities. This is the essential element any investor expects.\n\nSimilarly, privately-held Anam Phat Co., Ltd. has been awarded notice of surveying, researching, and investing in the Anam Phat Resort and Golf Course project in An Ninh Dong commune with total investment of VND2.8 trillion ($121 million) and premium urban area project Vuon Phuong Hoang (Phoenix Garden) in Tuy Hoa city, with total investment value touching VND5 trillion ($215 million).\n\nBui Quoc Hoan, the company\u2019s director said, \u201cPhu Yen has a lot of potential for tourism development.

All major sectors recorded notable growth, buoyed by manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail, and tourism.\n\nVietnam\u2019s strong economic growth would continue this year, driven by increasing FDI and robust domestic demand, said Suan Teck Kin, executive director of global economic and markets research of the United Overseas Bank (UOB), at the conference.\n\nIn the first half of this year, the economy grew 6.8 per cent year-on-year, driven by agriculture, forestry and fishery, industry and construction, and services.\n\nExports and industrial production remained significant growth drivers. Due to solid growth in the export of technological products and various free trade agreements, exports increased 7.3 per cent year-on-year, while imports jumped 10.5 per cent during the first half of this year.\n\nIndustrial production was boosted by continued opening of new multinational enterprises in labour-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing and processing industries.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we are projecting Vietnam\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 6.7 per cent and inflation of around 3.4 per cent for 2019. This will rank Vietnam as one of the fastest growing economies in the world,\u201d said Suan Teck Kin.\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is expected to maintain the refinancing rate at 6.25 per cent throughout this year.\n\nWith the current policy rate, the monetary policy stance remains conducive to the continuation of GDP growth, while preserving price stability.\n\nThe preservation of policy space was important given external uncertainties especially the ongoing US-China trade dispute, he said.\n\nThe strong economic growth also eases pressure on the central bank to introduce more stimuli to achieve the official growth target of 6.8 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor land transport, Vietnam benefits from bordering Laos, Cambodia and especially China, the region\u2019s key supplier of products and raw materials,\u201d said Suan Teck Kin.\n\nAs for sea transport, eastern Vietnam is a coastal area stretching from the north all the way to the south, with three major port cities in its northern, central and southern regions.\n\nSea transport from Vietnam requires a shorter distance of travel and less time, hence greater cost savings and faster speed to market, compared with island countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nApart from its geographic proximity to China, one of Vietnam\u2019s comparative advantages in attracting FDI is its relatively low labour cost, especially compared with China and Thailand.\n\nIn addition, Vietnam\u2019s demography was in a good position. According to United Nations, the population in Vietnam was estimated to be around 96 million, with about 70 per cent of its population between 15 and 64 years old in 2019, he said.\n\nHowever, one constraining factor for Vietnam is the relatively large proportion of the labour force engaged in the agriculture sector.\n\nThis could inhibit the speed of development of its manufacturing sector in the near-to-medium term, due to the limited supply of skilled workers. The direct impact of a shortage of skilled workers with the influx of investment and relocation is upward pressure on wages.\n\nAnother strength of Vietnam as an export production base is its excellent network of trade agreements. A total of 13 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have been signed and another three are under negotiation.\n\nThis means that Vietnamese exports to many major markets of the world are free from tariffs, offering opportunities for manufacturers relocating to Vietnam to sell to more at minimised cost.\n\nGiving advice on building factories in Vietnam, Hans Kerstens, head of sales and marketing of Deep C industrial zone, mentioned some factors to consider.\n\nThe first one is utilities including power, waste water treatment, water and drainage.\n\nThe others are customer services such as business licensing support, recruitment support, security, office space, cleaning and facilities management, and park maintenance.\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Nguyen Thi Xuan Thuy, deputy director of the industrial development centre under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said to participate in the global value chain, enterprises should join domestic and foreign trade fairs; connecting programmes with the presence of potential customers; associations of occupation, and set up unofficial groups to share and update information.\n\nShe also advised enterprises to create attractive capacity profiles; improve productivity, reduce production cost, compete in price and quality; enhance management capacity on quality, production and human resources.\n\nThe conference was organised as part of MTA Hanoi 2019.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/vietnam-asias-new-manufacturing-hub-71222.html", "published": "2019-10-18T10:15:06+07:00"}, {"title": "ADB solar plant loan provides investment impetus", "text": "ADB solar plant loan provides investment impetus\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) last week inked a $37 million deal with Da Nhim-Ham Thuan-Da Mi Hydro Power JSC (DHD) in order to help DHD install the 47.5MW floating solar power plant on a man-made reservoir at its existing 175MW Da Mi hydropower plant which was constructed in the 1990s with the financial support from Japan.\n\n\u201cThis project will help boost the share of renewable energy in Vietnam\u2019s overall energy mix and decrease the dependence on imported fossil fuels such as coal,\u201d deputy director general of ADB Private Sector Operations Department Christopher Thieme said at the signing ceremony last week in Hanoi.\n\n\u201cThe pairing of these two clean energy technologies \u2013 hydropower and solar \u2013 is a simple but highly innovative achievement which can be replicated elsewhere in Vietnam and across Asia and the Pacific,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mega project is part of Vietnam\u2019s plan to reduce its dependency on coal and boost energy production from renewable sources.\n\nThieme also told VIR, \u201cWe are working on a number of projects in Vietnam.

Most of the top 10 manufacturers have already set up factories in Vietnam, such as Trina Solar and JA Solar. Companies such as these are now scrambling to find new customers, both domestic and internationally, in a shored reversal of fortunes for an industry flooded with orders only a few years ago.\n\nAt the recent Solar Power Expo Vietnam in Hanoi, Ku Jun Heong, Trina Solar director of sales and marketing in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, said that Vietnam has always been an important market for the company.\n\n\u201cWith a deep understanding of the market, we built a production facility in the country, and achieved production capacity of 800MW annually. It shows our confidence in the solar potential of Vietnam,\u201d Heong said.\n\nAccording to the annual report of JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd., as of December 31, 2018 it had more than 900 customers for solar modules from China and 1,200 from other countries, including the United States, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Vietnam. Revenue from the Vietnamese market last year reached $148.52 million.\n\nLast August, JinkoSolar signed a 240MW solar module supply agreement with Powerchina Huadong Engineering Corporation Ltd. for the second phase of the 420MW Dau Tieng solar plant, which is expected to become the largest solar power project in Southeast Asia upon completion.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the domestic market demand for solar power and solar power products in the near term will continue to substantially depend on the availability of government incentives because the cost of solar energy currently exceeds, and will continue to exceed, the cost of conventional fossil fuel energy and certain non-solar renewable energy, particularly in light of the low level of oil prices in recent years,\u201d read a 2017 JinkoSolar report.\n\nThose are among many suppliers that are benefiting from a booming Vietnam solar arena thanks to the feed-in tariff (FiT). Besides that, the boom is riding on chances for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC), as well as banking.\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) stated in its report released in September on Vietnam\u2019s renewable energy market that Chinese players appear to be watching the market closely.\n\nChinese companies and banks have played an important role in the market, but not as developers, the report said. Chinese-led projects seem more than happy to have them play a crucial, indirect role as providers of new-generation, low-cost equipment with generous funding from Chinese banks. For example, the report noted, Thailand\u2019s B Grimm used a Chinese EPC and Chinese suppliers to construct solar farms in Vietnam. B Grimm paid just 10 per cent of what it owed its Chinese partners up front and is only required to begin repaying the rest over a year after construction begins. Subsequently, this financial flexibility has given B Grimm room for manoeuvre in Vietnam\u2019s solar market.\n\nChinese groups have reportedly gained a solid foothold by offering similar terms to other developers, leveraging the funding capacity of the major Chinese banks, according to the report.\n\nHowever, Mai Van Trung, business development director of locally-invested SolarBK, told VIR previously that inexperienced players join in the solar market by competing with low quality products with unknown origins. This could bring about many consequences for the market in the long term. Trung suggested that solar panels should have third-party guarantees such as MunichRE, SwissRE, or PowerGuard, which would prevent EPC contractors from mixing B-grade solar modules.\n\nEPC is the most critical part enabling the successful deployment of solar rooftop systems. The contractor typically provides everything from site survey and operation to maintenance services during the lifespan of a project, typically over 25 years, according to Trung.\n\nLessons are being made in a wider sense from India, which has been adding thousands of megawatts of solar power capacity, but this boom manifested into poor quality that will affect investor returns as EPC and developers failed to focus on maintaining systems post-construction, and only cared about costs.\n\nVietnam\u2019s medium-term plans for its renewable energy sector are now taking shape after two busy years of project development. According to the IEEFA report, the need to bring large amounts of new capacity online quickly \u2013 coupled with the desire for clean and secure power \u2013 has been the driving force spearheading renewables into the country.\n\nWith 4.46GW of solar power now coming online as the solar FiT programme hits its deadline, attention is shifting to plans for new grid investment and the next phase of the FiT programme which focuses on the burgeoning wind sector, the IEEFA stated.\n\nVietnam\u2019s renewables programme is gaining momentum at a strategic time. Vietnam has already electrified 99 per cent of its population. Now the demand for electricity is poised to increase. The revised National Power Development Master Plan VII currently forecasts commercial growth to grow at about 10.3 per cent annually until next year.\n\nIt is then expected to decrease somewhat, but still produce robust growth until 2030. The plan calls for capacity additions of between 6,000-7,000MW per year to meet the country\u2019s increased demand.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/experience-required-in-solar-sector-71082.html", "published": "2019-10-10T16:55:42+07:00"}, {"title": "Meeting the country\u2019s power needs", "text": "Vietnam is strongly improving the legal framework for renewable energy ( Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nSince 2017, Vietnam has had an attractive feed-in tariff (FiT) rate of 9.35 US cents per kilowatt hour for grid-connected solar projects. As of June 30, which was the deadline for this FiT rate, it was reported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) and Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) that 82 solar power plants with a total installed capacity of 4,464MW were successfully energised and put into operation.\n\nPartner Dang Chi Lieu and senior associate Nguyen Thanh Hai of Baker McKenzie Vietnam\n\nFor the next phase, the government has been working on new policies including new FiT regimes, additional rooftop solar power models, corporate/direct power purchase agreement (DPPA); a new guiding regulation on master planning; solar auction mechanisms; and potentially a revised model PPA. Certain work will need to be done to ensure the stability of the legal landscape, thus attracting more investments in the solar power sector.\n\nSolar encouragement\n\nThe Vietnamese government will soon pass a decision replacing 2017\u2019s Decision 11 on encouraging policies for the second FiT programme for solar power projects. Two key changes are new FiT rates and development mechanisms for rooftop solar systems.\n\nThe selection of an \u00adappropriate FiT regime to regulate new investment in the solar power sector can be important from a policy perspective. Based on the MoIT\u2019s proposal dated September 19, the new FiT proposed by the MoIT is 7.09 US cents per kWh for ground-mounted solar projects, 7.69 US cents per kWh for floating solar projects, and 9.35 US cents per kWh for rooftops.\n\nThis will be applied to the entire country, instead of varying depending on location as proposed previously. The new FiT will apply for projects achieving the commercial operation date from this July until the end of 2021 with a PPA term applicable for 20 years from actual commercial operation date.\n\nFor rooftop solar, in \u00adcomparison with Decision 11, which focuses only on rooftop solar systems for self-consumption purposes, the new decision would \u00adrecognise the role of third-party power developers for business purposes and, more specifically, set out four \u00addifferent models of implementation of rooftop solar, including:\n\n- The power consumption model, whereby the roof owner invests in and installs rooftop solar systems to use/consume a part of the power generated from rooftop systems and sells any excess energy output to the national grid;\n\n-The excess power sale business model, whereby the power developer or the roof owner invests in and installs rooftop solar systems to sell a part of the power generated from rooftop systems to other organisations/individuals and sells any excess energy output to the national grid;\n\n-The entire power sale business model, whereby the power developer or the roof owner invests in and installs rooftop solar systems to sell the entire power output produced from the systems to the national grid; and\n\n-The direct power sale and purchase model, whereby the power developer or the roof owner invests in, installs and sells power from its rooftop solar systems to other individuals and organisations with the exception of EVN without directly utilising the national grid systems.\n\nApart from the first model, which is essentially the same as the self-consumption model under \u00adDecision 11, the other three models will allow solar power developers to sell the entire or a portion of power output directly to its clients as power consumers, or EVN, or to both. These models are expected to encourage more rooftop solar power developers to invest in the rooftop solar space in Vietnam.\n\nA key issue which remains is that these rooftop solar models are proposed to apply to rooftop solar systems with an installed capacity of less than one megawatt peak for FiT determination and licensing requirement purposes.\n\nThe MoIT\u2019s Circular 36 issued last year on application for power generation licenses for power plants specifies that it applies to a rooftop solar system installed at one location and one connection point. However, the current law is not entirely clear as to how to determine this one MWp threshold.\n\nFor example, by \u201cone \u00adlocation\u201d, it is not clear as to how it will apply in case of a single developer installing multiple systems sharing the same roof. Also, for \u201cone connection point\u201d it remains unclear as to whether it is the connection point with EVN\u2019s grid or how it applies to the case of multiple systems sharing private wires.\n\nIf a rooftop solar \u00addeveloper installs rooftop systems for sub-lessors in an industrial zone, it is quite unclear whether this project will be considered one single project or divided into smaller sub-projects.\n\nThis is an issue that the MoIT has yet to fully clarify and, therefore, should take into account when they issue a guiding circular for the new decision and \u00adcirculars amending the grid code regulations and power operation licenses.\n\nImpact of the planning law\n\nAny newly proposed renewable project can only be developed after it has been included in the power development master plan. Before December 31, 2018, the MoIT approved the master plan inclusion for projects up to 50MWp, or proposed to the prime minister to approve projects larger than 50MWp.\n\nEffective from January this year, the Law on Planning provides that the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is the central agency to assist the government on the state management on master plans in coordination with other ministries and provincial people\u2019s committees.\n\nThe Standing Committee of the National Assembly recently issued Resolution No.751/2019/UBTVQH14 to interpret of some articles of the Law on Planning but it is not sufficient to address all the outstanding issues related to master plans to simplify the approval process for newly proposed projects in the master plans. Therefore, the MoIT has proposed to the government to formulate more guidelines to the said resolution specifically to the power and energy sector.\n\nFor the master plan in relation to power projects, the MoIT should still take the key role of reviewing, with certain consultation with the other ministries before it can be approved by the prime minister.\n\nGiven Resolution 751\u2019s interpretation of Article 59.1(c) of the Law on Planning, allowing for continued adjustments to existing master plans, it may help open a continued room for the government to consider including newly proposed projects into the existing amended Power Development Plan (PDP VII), rather than waiting for a new master plan.\n\nIf a newly proposed project wishes to apply for inclusion into the amended PDP VII, a key area to clarify is how much room for the government to approve additional capacity taking into account various factors, from the market status of developing solar projects, schedules of new grid systems investments to energy security and considerations of different power technologies in the power and energy mix in the Vietnam context.\n\nUpcoming policies\n\nThe Vietnamese government is considering some new policies for renewable energy. Among other things, policies that attract the most attention from investors are the DPPA pilot programme and the solar auction model.\n\nRegarding the DPPA pilot programme, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERAV) has been working on a DPPA pilot programme framework with some recent public consultation workshops and internal reports.\n\nThe ERAV plans to propose to the leaders of the MoIT and the government at the end of 2019 to review the implementation of a legal framework and a pilot programme on off-site virtual renewables DPPA in 2020.\n\nRegarding the solar auction, general application of a FiT for all solar projects may not be suitable with actual development costs of each project, and will only attract investments in certain regions generating the best profits from this FiT regime.\n\nThe government has its plan to organise auctions to select solar developers, which allow investors to propose power sale/purchase prices for their own projects. At the moment, the government is working out the specific auction mechanisms (substation-link model and solar park model) and may start with a pilot auction programme before launching a full programme on a national scale at a later period.\n\nDepending on actual progress, the solar auction may commence upon expiration of the FiT regime.\n\nFinally, following the government\u2019s issuance of the new decision replacing Decision 11, we expect that the MoIT will promulgate more guiding circular on the model PPAs for both grid-connected and rooftop solar power projects.\n\nThe current grid code regulations of the MoIT may also need further updates to align with new policies and recent market developments, addressing, among other things, the issues of integration of renewable energy sources into the power system for a more sustainable energy market in Vietnam.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/meeting-the-countrys-power-needs-71081.html", "published": "2019-10-10T16:51:11+07:00"}, {"title": "Vietnamese roll out Transformers inspired robot with green message", "text": "Made from recycled motorbike parts, 'Robot One' has an environmental message, says engineer Do Danh Phong (L) AFP/Nhac NGUYEN\n\n\"Hello everyone ...

Average monthly rents for factory ranged from $4-5 per sq.m per month. This rent remained flat compared to the first quarter.\n\nThe strong development in the manufacturing sector across provinces has also brought with it the great potential for the establishment of other real estate sectors. This has been proven by strong investment pouring into the real estate market in the northern provinces as witnessed recently.\n\nWith an increasing proportion of FDI pouring into the north over the past decade, Hai Phong, Bac Ninh, Hung Yen and Quang Ninh are also fast becoming focal points for investment apart from Ha Noi, according to JLL Viet Nam.\n\nThe BCI Asia statistic shows that, after Ha Noi, Hai Phong, Bac Ninh, Quang Ninh and Hung Yen are the top provinces in terms of the number of real estate developments. Apart from Quang Ninh, well-known for its Ha Long Bay and Van Don Special economic zone, the other three provinces have consistently led the north regarding industrial developments.\n\nBac Ninh and Hai Phong markets are strongly driven by residential projects being developed to capitalise on the growing housing demand from an increasing number of migrants and expats working in the provinces.\n\nUnlike Bac Ninh and Hai Phong where most developments are concentrated in the city centre, most projects in Hung Yen cluster along its boundary with Ha Noi, to benefit from the existing demand in this big city. Home to Ha Long Bay, Quang Ninh has been on the radar of many well-known developers, focusing on vacation and tourism-related properties.\n\nAbout 615 ha is planned to be launched during the next 12-month period.

It will also feature surveillance cameras that come with the capabilities to recognise faces together with AI.\n\nReality a long-term vision\n\nMarking the first milestone of the North Hanoi Smart City Project just before the 65th anniversary of Hanoi\u2019s Liberation on October 10, Nguyen Thi Nga, chairwoman of BRG Group said, \u201cWe build a smart city not for our generation, but for many Vietnamese generations of the future. Here, the capacity of Vietnamese people will be truly activated and maximised, thereby creating momentum to promote the country\u2019s socio-economic development.\u201d\n\nTen years ago, the businesswoman proposed to invest in a project on the two sides of the Nhat Tan-Noi Bai route. In May 2009, BRG Group was assigned the task. Since then, Nga and her partners have embarked on a journey of numerous challenges to realise the dream of a Hanoi for future Vietnamese generations.\n\n\u201cI still remember when the international planning contractor required a topographic survey for the entire 2,080 hectares, and to know the location of houses, temples, roads, or schools. Engaging in finance, I can see clearly the cost, not to mention challenges of time and its feasibility. But we still had to do it anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nShe could also never forget the sheer number of meetings with government and Hanoian authorities, besides overnight discussions with international consultants. \u201cSometimes the ideas of foreign architectural planners and management agencies were not unified, and work needed considering so many times. I felt tired and very lonely with almost no-one understanding or accompanying me, while I also needed to take care of the group\u2019s other issues,\u201d Nga said.\n\nHowever, with a great love for Hanoi and the desire to give people a new quality environment, Nga and BRG Group have now reached the next stage. In December 2015, under the authorisation of the Prime Minister, Hanoi officially approved the planning map.\n\nAfter completing the detailed plan, BRG Group has continuously sought partners. It required devoted partners and sharing of a mutual vision for sustainable development. The goal was to create a city of new vitality, bringing modern and classy living standards, and creating motivation for socio-economic development for the country.\n\nSumitomo Corporation, one of Japan\u2019s leading firms, ultimately officially shook hands with BRG Group to develop the smart city venture.\n\nHanoian heart and spirit\n\nMasayuki Hyodo, president and CEO of Sumitomo, said at the groundbreaking ceremony of the project that he \u201creally admires the vision and passion\u201d of the BRG Group leader.\n\n\u201cHer love for the country and for Hanoi is an inspiration,\u201d Hyodo said.\n\n\u201cThis project does not copy the model of any city, but is a beautiful scheme with the latest 4.0 technologies, bringing together a new quality of life for people,\u201d Hyodo emphasised.\n\nLocated on the main route linking Hanoi city centre with Noi Bai International Airport, the smart city project is considered to be a bridge to speed up commercial trade co-operation between Vietnam and other countries in the region and around the world.\n\nAccording to the plan for the BRG-Sumitomo joint venture, people will enjoy the maximum benefits from comprehensive development of modern and sustainable infrastructure, thereby accelerating the process of socio-economic development in the capital city.\n\nThe smart city venture will apply many advanced technologies across areas such as smart energy, smart mobility, smart governance, smart learning, smart economy and smart living. A smart building management system and renewable energy technology will also be prioritised to optimise energy supply and storage.\n\nIn parallel with the smart city design, it is expected that the joint venture will also build a detailed plan on the application of 5G technology, face recognition, and blockchain.\n\nDeveloping smart cities will not only support Hanoi to solve existing problems in, for instance, transport infrastructure, healthcare, education, energy, and inadequacies in urban management and planning; but it will also activate new growth engines for the country, soon realising the resolutions on Industry 4.0 that the Politburo has just promulgated, which focuses on the target of at least three smart cities in three key economic regions across the country by 2025.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/billion-dollar-smart-city-will-express-the-spirit-and-vision-of-a-new-hanoi-71137.html", "published": "2019-10-14T15:28:01+07:00"}, {"title": "VN index ends up lower as correcting pressure rises", "text": "Vietcombank (VCB) closed Thursday down nearly 1 per cent at VN\u011085,200 per share.

More than one million clean water and sanitation facilities in rural areas were built using the bank's loans. The bank\u2019s policy credit also contributed to building more than 12,000 houses to help needy households stabilise their life and build over 3,000 social housing units in light of governmental Decree No.100/2015/ND-CP.\n\nAs of September 30, 2019, VBSP posted VND200.813 trillion ($8.73 billion) in total cumulative outstanding loan balance, up VND13.021 trillion ($566.13 million) compared to the end of 2018, a 6.9 per cent jump, with more than 6.5 million needy households and other policy beneficiaries still holding loans from the bank.\n\nVBSP posted VND200.813 trillion ($8.73 billion) in total cumulative outstanding loan balance in the first nine months this year, a 6.9 per cent jump on-year\n\nThe efficiency of policy credit programmes not only grows in proportion with credit growth but also promises new breakthroughs and greater spill-over effects through the new mindset and action of VBSP itself, local government, associated organisations, and needy households alike.\n\nFor instance, local governments at all levels have been proactive in diversifying capital sources to lend for needy households and other policy beneficiaries in their areas. As of September 30, 2019, total capital sources from the provincial-budget allocated to VBSP amounted to VND14.618 trillion ($635.57 million) compared to the end of 2018.\n\nBesides, communal authorities also made an effort to boost access to loans for needy households and policy beneficiaries in their areas through increasing authorised capital provision to VBSP.\n\nTake Lap Vo district\u2019s Binh Thanh Chung commune in the Mekong delta province of Dong Thap for example, where the rate of needy households in the area in 2012 was 13.4 per cent (553 out of 4,100 households). The commune had worked with artist Minh Luan to successfully host a performance night to raise funding to aid needy people in the area with a total mobilised sum reaching VND368 million ($16,000).\n\nIn the previous six years, this modest sum was lent out to 42 needy households in the area and helped 26 escape poverty. This contributed to bringing the rate of needy households in the commune to just 3.5 per cent by the end of last year.\n\nThe government\u2019s capital sources have been used flexibly, such as being embedded into diverse local programmes on economic development, as well as crop structure and animal husbandry transformation, then generating high added value, helping needy households and other policy beneficiaries to shorten the gap in income and economic integration between localities and regions.\n\nSimilarly, southern Ninh Thuan province has been using government capital sources to promote lending into focal projects such as those on weaving development and traditional pottery, helping needy households gradually shape up large-scale production models and create more jobs in the province.\n\nThe family of Han Thi Trung in Phuoc Dan townlet, Ninh Phuoc district is a shining example. Her family was lifted out of poverty in 2010 by virtue of a VBSP loan to develop brocade weaving.\n\nIn 2013, the family took out a VND70 million ($3,040) loan from a VBSP capital package earmarked for job creation to invest in weaving machines to replace the manual method. Early last year, the family took up another VND200 million ($8,690) from VBSP to further invest in weaving machines and expand the workshop. Her family\u2019s workshop can now provide stable jobs for 10 local labourers.\n\nThe dynamic economic models inspired by VBSP in the community have contributed to engaging needy households and other policy beneficiaries into a bigger production value chain of higher added value. This is also the direction VBSP and localities in the country are building in a bid to boost added value from production, leveraging policy credit sources in the forthcoming years.\n\nThe large-scale commodity-based production models gearing towards integrating into diverse value chains have spelled the need to increase the lending amount to needy households and other policy beneficiaries, helping them to improve their life effectively and more quickly engage in the country\u2019s international economic integration course.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/vbsp-on-17-year-proud-development-journey-71159.html", "published": "2019-10-15T17:51:42+07:00"}, {"title": "Kien Giang invites investment in key tourism regions", "text": "A resort in Phu Quoc Island (Photo: VNA)\n\nThe locality is also focusing on building and developing a system of unique and high-quality tourism products and services encompassing eco-tourism, sea and island tourism, and cultural tourism.\n\nLocal authorities have called on businesses to cooperate in training human resources to realise the goal of having 20,000-25,000 tourism workers by 2020.\n\nThe province is studying the development of international tours by coordinating with airlines to promote the launch of direct and charter flights for tourists.

military, with the state-owned China Sam Group on Sep 22.\n\nA day previously, China and the Solomons officially established diplomatic relations after Beijing persuaded the impoverished Pacific

such strategic uses down the road.\"\n\nTaiwan was previously the Solomons' largest ally in the Pacific region and the decision to ditch it for China after months of speculation was seen as a major diplomatic coup for Beijing.\n\nDays later another Taipei loyalist in the region, Kiribati, did likewise.\n\nASSERTIVE CHINA\n\nThe manoeuvring left Taiwan with just four nations that officially recognise it in the Pacific and 15 worldwide, while also alarming traditional western democratic powers.\n\nThe Pacific has long been a proxy battleground for Taiwan and China, with local leaders adept at playing one against the other for financial gain.\n\nChina has become more assertive in the Pacific as its economic might has grown and sees Taiwan as a renegade state which will eventually be unified with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nOther regional heavyweights, particularly Australia, fear Beijing's ultimate aim is to set up a naval base in the Pacific which would dramatically increase its military footprint in the area.\n\nSuch a move would potentially negate the geographic remoteness that provides Australia and New Zealand with a valuable defence buffer.\n\nHowever, China Sam's arrangement with Central Province may count for little as it has not been approved by the central government in Honiara.\n\nCentral's Premier Stanley Manetiva played down its impacts in an interview with Radio New Zealand.\n\n\"To be honest here, leasing Tulagi will not be possible,\" he said. \"Nothing will eventuate on the agreement.\"\n\nWhether or not the deal goes ahead, the Lowy Institute's Pryke said the diplomatic upheavals between China and Taiwan were affecting good governance in the region.\n\n\"Corruption by its very nature is hard to quantify and

On the revenue side, measures include the environmental protection tax and natural resources tax. On the expenditure side, a threshold of 1 per cent of the total annual state budget expenditure for environmental protection has been implemented since 2006.\n\nThese instruments are supplemented by measures such as tax incentives for electric cars, lower tax rates for biofuel, preferential corporate income tax rates and exemptions for enterprises investing in environment and climate change mitigation technologies, and green credit policy.\n\nWith the adoption of the National Green Growth Strategy in 2012, the government set an ambitious framework for the shift of the growth model towards a green economy. Implementation should now be directed towards accelerating the process of economic restructuring, making best use of green fiscal instruments, and incentivising public and private investment in the green economy.\n\nWhat are the main impacts of German support to the Ministry of Finance (MoF) here on green fiscal instruments, and what has been achieved so far?\n\nSince the implementation of the environmental protection tax (EPT) in 2012, meaningful positive impacts have been reached. The EPT introduced a comprehensive package of taxes targeting pollutants such as fossil fuels, coal, plastic bags, and more. It also consolidated existing tax and fee instruments into a single tax regime.\n\nThe objective of the EPT is to shift to a more economical and efficient use of natural resources and contribute to environment protection by implementing a \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle.\n\nThe EPT has contributed to decrease total carbon dioxide emissions by 1.7 per cent in 2012 and 2013, and is expected to generate 4.8 per cent of total state budget revenue in 2019, with total collection reaching an estimated VND68 trillion ($3 billion). Since implementation the tax rates have been increased twice. The EPT revenues are not earmarked and thus assigned to the general state budget, which makes public acceptance of the tax more challenging as the revenue use is not directly assigned to the task of environmental protection or other specific objectives.\n\nWhat are the main contents of the green finance and fiscal instruments with which GIZ is supporting the MoF?\n\nNotably, we have been accompanying the ministry during the preparatory stages of the EPT law. Based on a careful impact assessment taking into consideration social, environmental, and economic aspects, we have been advising on the policy design.\n\nWe also support the MoF in development of a concept for comprehensive green fiscal reform, and in its implementation. The MoF\u2019s Green Growth Action Plan for the financial sector includes specific measures such as the introduction of green public procurement, fees for environmental protection including charges on wastewater and mineral exploitation, and green credit policy.\n\nWhat should the government and the MoF in particular do to implement this in the most effective way?\n\nWith climate change, tax and expenditure systems will need to adapt to fiscal consequences and provide the necessary resources and mechanisms to mitigate and adapt to its impacts.\n\nIn the medium-term, the EPT should be revised to increase its effectiveness. One option in line with international best practice is the introduction of a carbon price \u2013 for example, integrating a carbon tax within the EPT \u2013 sufficiently high enough to drive transition towards a low-carbon economy. This would raise substantial additional revenues and have significant positive climate and environmental impacts. Policymakers can choose to redistribute parts of the revenue to the poorest households, lower other taxes, or use revenues partly for environmental purposes.\n\nState budget expenditure for environmental protection should also be reviewed according to the effectiveness criteria, and the scale of spending assessed to better reflect the needs for environmental protection.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/gizs-concepts-support-green-growth-reforms-in-vietnam-71131.html", "published": "2019-10-14T11:53:36+07:00"}, {"title": "The next phase of online retail and shopping", "text": "By David Anjoubault General manager Worldpanel Division Kantar Vietnam\n\nKantar Worldpanel is forecasting that big bets will be placed on the near future in hybrid retail and super-convenience. In Vietnam, we may well see the rise of social commerce and direct-to-consumer sales. The concept of social commerce is the platform where everyone can be a retailer by opening an online store and shoppers can make payments in different ways, either by cash on delivery or via a digital wallet.\n\nIntelligent technology is also a major factor applied in the retail segment. The omnichannel trend will be evolving fast with new retail developing, aided by the advancement of new technology. As a result, the shopper\u2019s path to purchase becomes even more sophisticated and complex. This is amplified by different factors like marketing embedded AI and machine learning technology, the evolution of shipping services, and the continued rise of cashless payments.\n\nIn general, online, mini, and specialty stores will continue to lead future growth. There is still huge potential for these emerging channels to growth further in both shopper base, shopping trips, and shopper spend, especially online.\n\nAround 60 per cent of urban Vietnamese households will shop for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) online by 2025. As such, the future growth of e-commerce will be continuously driven by growing connectivity, especially via mobile phones. From our latest data updated to the end of last year, up to 95 per cent of urban households now own at least one smartphone.\n\nThe second driver is consumers\u2019 active engagement with digital platforms, which nurture mobile shopping from consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer. The third is the strong push from both pure players and third parties like delivery apps with lots of promotion campaigns stimulating consumer spending online.\n\nHowever, online methods will not completely replace physical stores in the next decade. Consumers do not just move from channel to channel. They have a growing tendency to shop for FMCG products across a wider variety of channels to serve different shopping missions. Simply put, they will visit mother and child stores for shopping for baby products and might prefer to shop for imported instant noodles in mini stores or hypermarkets rather than in a nearby street shop.\n\nIn addition, we are seeing another rising shopping trend when life gets busy. Shoppers actually shop less often and want to save time by reducing their trips.\n\nTherefore, there will be fewer opportunities for brands and retailers to win the moment of truth.\n\nTo respond to today\u2019s new retail environment and to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s transformation, key retailers are taking the lead in establishing a variety of retail formats in order to meet shoppers wherever they are.\n\nIn the next five years, this will revolve around super convenience, customisation, ultra-fast delivery times, meaningfulness, and trust.\n\nOn top of that, tech-based innovations are promising to bring shoppers greater convenience, and a seamless and personalised experience. Some relevant applications to watch out for in Vietnamese retail could be unmanned stores, scan and go, click and collect with pick-up points, mobile formats, or kiosks with voice assistants.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/the-next-phase-of-online-retail-and-shopping-71088.html", "published": "2019-10-11T07:00:13+07:00"}, {"title": "Business shake up set with Labour Code draft", "text": "Minh Nguyen, senior associate of ACSV Legal\n\nThe latest draft offers revised definitions of \u201cemployer\u201d, \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201clabour contract\u201d to recognise the evolution of labour relationships under the impact of Industry 4.0. According to the revised definitions which were built upon the principle of substance trumping formality, any agreement containing the three elements of to-do tasks, compensation/salary, and supervision and direction from the paying party will be classified as a labour agreement regardless of the agreement\u2019s name or label.\n\nThis change, will guide law enforcement bodies to better characterise the relationships between part-time or seasonal workers and technology companies such as those between drivers and ride-hailing companies like Grab or Go-Viet. On the other hand, the change will help to prevent certain companies from using a service contract or an independent contractor agreement to disguise a labour contract with an aim to avoid the payment of income taxes or mandatory social insurances to the state.\n\nEmployee termination rights\n\nCurrently, under the Labour Code, an employee has the right to terminate the labour contract but must provide prior notice to the employer. Violating this procedural rule will result in an illegal termination of the labour contract where the employer can claim compensation from the employee. The latest draft grants further rights to employees in this respect by allowing an employee to terminate the labour contract immediately without a prior notice in several circumstances.\n\nThe first is if the employee is not assigned to the correct position or work location or is not ensured the working conditions as previously agreed in the labour contract. Second is if the employee is not paid in full or on time the wages due as agreed in the labour contract, unless the late payment or insufficient payment is permitted by the labour code or otherwise agreed by the employee and the employer. The third is if the employee is maltreated, sexually harassed, or is subject to forced labour. The final circumstance applies if the employee reaches retirement age.\n\nIllegal termination\n\nAn employer can dismiss an employee in the case that the employee is absent from work without a justified reason for five accumulated working days within a period of one month from the first day of absence or 20 accumulated working days within a period of a year from the first day of absence without justified reasons. However, as per the latest draft, this circumstance no longer gives rise to a cause for dismissal.\n\nInstead, the draft adds a clause providing that if an employee is absent from work for six consecutive working days without a prior notification, the employee\u2019s act will constitute an illegal termination of the labour contract. More changes might follow in this regard as not all seems to be clarified yet.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest draft bans an employer from explicitly forcing an employee to perform obligations under a labour contract to repay debts owed to the employer. Such prohibition does not exist in the current Labour Code.\n\nAmendment of contract term\n\nCurrently, Article 5 of Decree No.05/2015/ND-CP issued in 2015 on detailing and guiding a number of provisions of the Labour Code allows both parties to a labour contract to amend the contract term by an annex. Many companies have used this provision to prolong the period an employee working under definite-term contracts before signing an indefinite-term contract.\n\nFor example, in practice, some companies have asked employees to sign a definite-term contract and then an annex to extend this contract term, and after that another similar contract circle. To remove this loophole, the latest draft clearly prohibits the use of an annex to amend the labour contract term.\n\nProbation duration\n\nUnder the Labour Code, the probationary period shall not exceed 60 days regardless of the probation positions. However, for candidates working in high-level managerial positions it often takes more time to evaluate the qualifications and suitability of the candidates. Therefore, a new provision is added into the draft allowing a longer probationary period for managerial positions with a maximum term of 180 days.\n\nAutomatic conversion\n\nAccording to the latest draft, if an employee keeps working for the employer after expiry of the probationary period, the employee is deemed to have passed the probation and the employer must sign a labour contract with the employee. This is a new provision.\n\nApprenticeships\n\nTo make the Labour Code consistent with the 2014 Law on Vocational Education, lawmakers have proposed certain changes in the Labour Code on apprenticeship and on-the-job training. Accordingly, the latest draft clearly sets out the requirements for an employer who wishes to recruit an apprentice or trainee.\n\nOne requirement is that a term for apprenticeship is a maximum of 12 months, and a maximum of three months for on-the-job training. An employer must commit to recruit the apprentice or trainee if he or she is at least 15 years old at the time of the training completion. Also, an employer must enter into a vocational training contract with the apprentice or trainee in accordance with the Law on Vocational Education.\n\nSexual harassment\n\nEven though according to the current Labour Code sexual harassment is prohibited, there is no clear definition thereof. The latest draft now defines sexual harassment for the first time. It also sets out remedies in case an employee has committed an act of sexual harassment towards another employee at the workplace, which includes the victim having the right to unilaterally terminate the labour contract with immediate effect without a prior notice; and the employer having the right to dismiss the employee in violation.\n\nWork and rest overtime\n\nUnder the current Labour Code, the maximum overtime working hours in a year in a standard situation is 200, equivalent to an average of half an hour of overtime per day. However, many companies, especially those in manufacturing and processing, have indicated that this ceiling is low, and it prevents them from efficiently meeting the demands from the market.\n\nTaking this issue into account, the latest draft specifies the circumstances and industries where the amount of overtime hours can reach up to 400 hours per year. Similarly, the maximum overtime working hours per month has been increased from 30 to 40. According to the current Labour Code, an employee who has not fully taken annual leave regardless of the reason is entitled to a payment for the untaken leave days.\n\nThe latest draft proposes a change in this regard. Notably, an employee can get paid for the untaken leave days only in case of employment termination or job loss.\n\nMaternity and work\n\nRight now, an employer must not require a female employee, regardless of her wish, to perform night work, overtime work, and go on a long-distance trip when she is in her seventh month of pregnancy, or in her sixth month of pregnancy in the case of working in mountainous, remote, border, and island areas; or in the case of nursing a child under 12 months of age. The latest draft removes this prohibition and leaves the decision in the hands of the female employee.\n\nFemale employees who perform heavy work are entitled to lighter work or have her daily working time reduced by an hour upon reaching the seventh month of pregnancy, while still receiving her full wage. With an aim to create more favourable conditions for pregnant women or women raising infants at the workplace, the latest draft has expanded the subjects of said entitlement to female employees who are pregnant or are raising a child under 12 months.\n\nUnder the current Labour Code, there is a list of jobs for which an employer is not allowed to hire a female employee. The latest draft removes this list and only mentions the jobs affecting child-bearing and parenting functions of female employees. Employers can hire female employees for these jobs but must provide her with relevant protective materials.\n\nRetirement age\n\nCurrently, the retirement age is 55 for a female and 60 for a male employee. The latest draft increases the retirement age to 60 and 62 for a female and male employee respectively under a specific roadmap. As of January 2021, the retirement age shall increase each year by three months for a male employee and by four months for a female employee until it reaches 62 for males in 2028 and 60 for females in 2035.\n\nWork permit exemption\n\nCurrently a non-national who is the owner of an limited liability company or a board member of a joint-stock company in Vietnam, or who is studying and working at the same time in Vietnam, is not required to obtain a work permit. The latest draft proposes the following changes: firstly, a foreigner in the aforementioned situation is exempted to obtain a work permit only when he or she has contributed at least VND1 billion (nearly $43,500) to such company; secondly, a foreigner who is studying and working in Vietnam shall no longer be exempted from obtaining a work permit; and the latest draft also adds a new subject for work permit exemption \u2013 foreign employees married to a Vietnamese citizen and living in Vietnam.\n\nThe Labour Code as it stands sets out the procedures of issuance and re-issuance of a work permit, which means that when a work permit is about to expire, it cannot be renewed, but only be re-issued. In contrast, the latest draft allows for a one-time renewal.\n\nInternal labour regulations\n\nThe Labour Code has caused confusion about when a company is obliged to issue internal labour rules (ILRs) and under which form these need to be made. The latest draft corrects this shortcoming and all companies must issue ILRs, regardless of the number of employees. As for companies with at least 10 employees, the ILRs must be registered with the labour authorities. Of note, the ILRs must clearly set out disciplinary procedures to punish sexual harassment behaviour.\n\nDispute arbitration\n\nFor the first time ever, arbitration could be used to settle labour disputes. According to the latest draft, labour disputes related to individual rights or collective rights must go through mediation before reaching court litigation or arbitration. The award issued by the arbitral tribunal shall be final, binding, and enforceable as if it is a commercial arbitration award.\n\nBipartite co-operation board\n\nThe establishment of a bipartite co-operation board in the workplace is introduced in the latest draft. The board aims to enhance mutual understanding between employees and employers and to foster dialogue to discuss solutions for common concerns in the workplace.\n\nThis board also functions as an intermediary agent, liaising between the employer and the employees or between the employer and the trade union in finalising certain internal policies and regulations of the company. An employer with at least 200 employees is obliged to establish such a board.\n\nDisciplinary action\n\nLabour leasing services are allowed under the current Labour Code so long as a provider has obtained the required sub-licenses. However, it is currently silent on how a labour-leasing enterprise could handle violations of internal rules and policies of the hiring party which were committed by the leased employees.\n\nThe latest draft provides a solution for this issue by clearly setting out that the labour-leasing enterprise could rely on the hiring party\u2019s internal labour rules to apply a similar disciplinary action to the leased employees in violation, even though such a violation is not mentioned in the internal labour rules of the labour leasing enterprise.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/business-shake-up-set-with-labour-code-draft-71071.html", "published": "2019-10-10T15:49:58+07:00"}, {"title": "HCM City needs to upgrade industrial zones to attract FDI: experts", "text": "Hiep Phuoc Industrial Park in Nha Be District, HCM City.

The city needs to improve the efficiency of land use to reduce rentals and also strengthen linkages with other zones in the southern region, Trinh Ngoc Vu an expert in economics said.\n\nLast year the city\u2019s EPZs and IPs attracted $772.3 million worth of investment, but only $290.8 million worth of foreign investment, a drop of 25.8 per cent from 2017, according to Hepza.\n\nMost projects were in technology-oriented industries, including food processing, chemical-rubber, information technology, and supporting industries.", "link": "https://www.vir.com.vn/hcm-city-needs-to-upgrade-industrial-zones-to-attract-fdi-experts-71013.html", "published": "2019-10-08T11:02:50+07:00"}]}, "Vietnam News": {"link": "https://vietnamnews.vn/", "articles": []}, "Tuoitre  News": {"link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/", "articles": [{"title": "Hospital clarifies 'misinformation' after staff accused of dumping medical waste into Saigon canal - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20191019/hospital-clarifies-misinformation-after-staff-accused-of-dumping-medical-waste-into-saigon-canal/51609.html", "published": "2019-10-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Photo contest highlights women's daily life in Vietnam - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/lifestyle/20191019/photo-contest-highlights-women-s-daily-life-in-vietnam/51604.html", "published": "2019-10-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Southeast Asia's mobile payments face shakeout as market booms - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/business/20191019/southeast-asia-s-mobile-payments-face-shakeout-as-market-booms/51603.html", "published": "2019-10-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Suspects arrested in contamination of Hanoi\u2019s water source - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20191019/suspects-arrested-in-contamination-of-hanois-water-source/51602.html", "published": "2019-10-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Breakfast @ Tuoi Tre News \u2013 October 19 - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20191019/breakfast-tuoi-tre-news-october-19/51601.html", "published": "2019-10-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The art of soap carving in northern Thailand - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/lifestyle/20191019/the-art-of-soap-carving-in-northern-thailand/51600.html", "published": "2019-10-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Cartel gunmen terrorize Mexican city, free El Chapo's son - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/international/20191018/cartel-gunmen-terrorize-mexican-city-free-el-chapo-s-son/51599.html", "published": "2019-10-18T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Vietnam establishes cybersecurity emergency response center - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20191018/vietnam-establishes-cybersecurity-emergency-response-center/51598.html", "published": "2019-10-18T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Vietnamese couple maintains long-standing family tradition of rock sugar production - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/lifestyle/20191018/vietnamese-couple-maintains-longstanding-family-tradition-of-rock-sugar-production/51597.html", "published": "2019-10-18T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Two former Vietnamese ministers prosecuted in scandalous acquisition deal - Tuoi Tre News", "text": "The top public prosecutor\u2019s office of Vietnam said on Saturday it has prosecuted two former ministers of information and communications along with 12 other defendants related to a scandalous US$391 million deal where state-run telco MobiFone attempted to acquire almost the entirety of a private firm.\n\nThe former ministers, Nguyen Bac Son and Truong Minh Tuan, are indicted on the charges of \u201cviolating regulations on the management and use of public capital, causing serious consequences\u201d and \u201creceiving bribes\u201d, the Supreme People\u2019s Procuracy of Vietnam said.\n\nSon, 66, and Tuan, 59, had roles in the notorious deal in 2015, in which MobiFone tried to buy a 95 percent stake in Audio Visual Global JSC (AVG), a pay-per-view private TV company, prosecutors found.\n\nSon was minister of information and communications for the 2011-16 tenure, while Tuan assumed the same office between 2016 and 2018.\n\nMobiFone, one of the country\u2019s leading mobile network operators, is an entity owned entirely by the state and has been under the management of the Ministry of Information and Communications since December 2014.\n\nFormer AVG Chairman Pham Nhat Vu is indicted on the charge of \u201cgiving bribes\u201d.\n\nVu allegedly gave Son and Tuan $3 million and $200,000, respectively, after the deal was signed in 2015, police concluded last month.\n\nFormer AVG Chiarman Pham Nhat Vu.

They look like they are going to have a heart attack. Or worse; get hit by phone texting parents moto\u2019ing the kids to school. Nothing healthy about that, hey?\n\nSurely there are better ways to get fit than risking your life running around the Vietnamese landscape. Yet expats and tourists love to scoot, pedal, run and wobble on bikes where you never know what\u2019s around the corner and the locals are not expecting Lycra-clad foreigners sprinting towards them. Far madder too is the idea of marathons in summer and \u2018hash harrier\u2019 running clubs from pub to pub.\n\nI find it fascinating that women tend to do yoga while men do more physical activities like football to stay fit in Vietnam\u2019s high humidity climate where you can simply sweat off the weight when you leave the house. Yep, twisting yourself into embarrassing positions on a mat in front of strangers is surely to add years to your lifespan and slamming into others while trying to kick a ball will do wonders for your knees in later life also. At least that\u2019s what they claim when they hobble into the coffee shop the next day.\n\nMind you, I do get the idea of getting the old joints moving as you get older.\n\nEven though I hate exercise and sport in general, I do acknowledge the health benefits; particularly now that I\u2019m sixty-one years old. With some great reluctance I\u2019ve started to take up home exercises for my back and legs as I sit too often for long periods of time at the computer. I do some squats, lunges and use a pair of bricks for some light weight training. I hope it\u2019s working but I might smash my mirror at some point.\n\nPeople jog in a park in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. Photo: Duyen Phan / Tuoi Tre\n\nI did try a local gym but quit horrified at the number of young Vietnamese strutting around the place hoping to get the female office workers to notice them while jogging on the running machine. Now I\u2019m not sure if this is all that healthy as people tend to do this early in the morning when their bodies are struggling to get moving or the mid-evenings when everyone\u2019s exhausted from work. Maybe they\u2019re just avoiding the daily parental questions of when they are getting married.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced about the weights either. Is the grandma carting veggies a few miles to the market on bamboo poles across her back fitter than the rest of us?\n\nCheap or free entry to swimming pools is difficult to find despite 3,000 miles of beach. Is it a cheap excuse by expats not to exercise or a genuine tale of hardship by foreigners who can afford two-hundred-thousand evening meals delivered to the front door? However if you hunt around the villas and hotels or discover someone has a backyard pool, you can find a bargain and make new friends too; much better than the sweaty, smelly, noisy gyms.\n\nWhat\u2019s marvelous is the increasing popularity of low-impact water-based exercise for older people (like me) during our blistering summers. I\u2019m planning to get into that when I find a swimsuit that hides my middle-age fat brilliantly (patience, Stivi, patience) or sooner if I discover everyone at the fitness classes is uglier than me when we take off our shirts!\n\nWhat would really help is to eat more Vietnamese food. These days I eat about sixty percent local food and the rest is Western food per week. I\u2019ve lost quite a few kilos this way without breaking into a sweat and I highly recommend this tactic to everyone. The other thing is reducing how much food I actually gobble during a meal. It\u2019s amazing how huge Western meals have become, filling the whole plate and adding French fries to everything is doing more to kill us than anything else, I imagine.\n\nIt\u2019s funny too how exercise freaks pig out on lots of fruit drinks and vegan meals yet they\u2019re still adding on the calories. Go figure\u2026 In any case, I think it\u2019s better to get a dog and take him for a walk as often as you can. Provided you live somewhere that\u2019s suitable for dogs, this is a nifty way to perk yourself, exercise both you and the dog and show the world you\u2019re a caring person. It sends more signals than a jogger, hey?\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to do my exercise and get something to eat. I wonder if I have any chocolate in the fridge\u2026hmm.", "link": "https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/city-diary/20190714/getting-fit-in-vietnam/50652.html", "published": "2019-07-14T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Expats on why Vietnam is among best countries for foreigners -

Tuoi Tre News", "text": "A Vietnamese freelance actor teamed up with his best friend to initiate a YouTube channel to give hilarious but honest reviews about trendy street food among the youth in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nGia Phu and Trong Dien, who prefers to be called Meo (Cat), are co-founders of \u2018PM Food Travel\u2019, a YouTube channel featuring different kinds of street food around Saigon, the former name of Ho Chi Minh City, and remarks on them to satisfy food lovers in Vietnam and all over the world.\n\n\u2018PM Food Travel\u2019 distinguished from others from the intro song, based on famous Vietnamese children\u2019s series soundtrack of Kinh Van Hoa to Gia Phu\u2019s attractive style of talking as well as familiar types of street food they chose to review, which remind viewers of their childhood and their adaptations.\n\nPhu said that the two of them had different ability for acting and filming videos, but both shared the ultimate love for traveling and exploring national and international cuisines, especially street food.\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? Great minds think alike,\u201d he recalled the reason they decided to cooperate to become YouTubers.\n\nPhu always tried his best to provide basic information from the origin, location and interesting facts about the dish while Meo set his heart and soul on producing best quality videos from visual to sound effect.\n\nPhu makes friendly conversations with street vendors to add some spice to his videos. Photo: Supplied\n\nWhat captured the heart of viewers were friendly conversations between Gia Phu and street vendors in each video to explore more details about the dish as well as extraordinary things in it.\n\n\u201cWe want viewers to feel as if they were talking to the vendor themselves instead of just listening to my reviewing,\u201d said the owner of \u2018PM Food Travel\u2019.\n\nHe also shared that they tried their best to give honest and contributive reviews to build the trust among local followers and promote Vietnamese cuisine to foreign viewers without affecting the vendor\u2019s feeling or their manufacture as quality was always their priority in work.\n\n\u201cQuality, affordable price range and uniqueness are main factors that contribute a lot to our products,\u201d said Meo about their work regime.\n\nGia Phu said that YouTuber was a flexible job in which they could manage to do other things and take proper rest, but the pressure was finding new ideas to maintain the quality of their videos instead of producing lame and boring old stuff all over again.\n\n\u201cWhat to do, what to do, what to do today?\u201d Phu humorously shared about his work motto.\n\nGia Phu always starts his videos with verses of famous Vietnamese children\u2019s series Kinh Van Hoa while Meo carefully films every shot.

This result marks the second consecutive quarter that Sendo\u2019s website has seen a 10% increase in traffic over the previous quarter.\n\nBesides that, their mobile application still holds the second position nationwide in terms of number of downloads.\n\nThese two positive results highlight a successful 2019 for Sendo. In June, at the Vietnam Startup Investment Fund Forum 2019, Mr. Tran Hai Linh, CEO of Sendo, revealed that operation-wise, the e-commerce company was already profitable.\n\nUnlike its competitors, Sendo has so far been focusing on customers in all regions, not just big cities. Their solutions towards this goal are proving to be fruitful, especially in attracting new users on both web platform and application.\n\nContrary to the growth of Sendo, its major competitors Shopee Vietnam, Tiki, and Lazada Vietnam all saw a decrease in website traffic.\n\nWebsite of e-commerce platform Tiki, after having achieved the second place nationwide for a long time, has now ceded this position to Sendo. However, their mobile app went in the opposite direction: up from fourth in downloads to third, surpassing Lazada\u2019s.\n\niPrice Group predicted that the decline in Tiki\u2019s website traffic (from 33.7 million / month to 27.1 million / month) could be a temporary fluctuation in the context that the company is focusing on improving their infrastructures. At the annual partner meeting in September, Mr. Tran Ngoc Thai Son, Tiki\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Directors shared that in the next 3 quarters, the company will increase the number of warehouses to optimize both the ability to store goods and shipping speed.\n\nLazada Vietnam\u2019s website now for the first time ranks at 5th nationwide. Just last year, Lazada Vietnam was still in the top 2 websites. However, a big consolation for Lazada Vietnam is that their mobile app still ranks second in monthly active users, behind only Shopee Vietnam. These contradictory results once again show that Lazada\u2019s total focus on mobile strategy is paying off.\n\nBesides those fluctuations, the number one Vietnamese e-commerce platform title still belongs firmly to Shopee. The company\u2019s website has the fifth consecutive quarter in the number one position with 34.5 million visits / month.

Hong Nhung reports on VNEconomictimes.\n\nThe country owes its improving strength in trade readiness to infrastructure enhancements and improvements to its ease of doing business score, while its economic dynamism is driven by healthy growth, particularly in terms of export volumes. It is ranked sixth among 20 economies with the greatest potential for trade growth in the Trade20 Index.\n\nAccording to the study, economic and political reforms over recent decades have spurred Vietnam\u2019s economic growth, bolstered by strong domestic demand and manufacturing-led export success.\n\nThe market has solid foundations for growth: it is politically stable, well-located for global supply chains, and has a relatively young population. The government has built on these foundations, focusing on business reforms and deregulation, investing in human capital and infrastructure and embracing trade liberalization.\n\nThe research also suggests that Vietnam\u2019s growth is likely to continue to be driven by FDI-led manufacturing and export growth. Rising tourism inflows and stronger domestic demand, supported by higher wages, are also expected to help Vietnam sustain its strong growth.\n\nRelated: Company formation in Vietnam\n\nThe Vietnamese Government has entered into a number of free trade agreements, with the latest being the landmark EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, which is expected to eventually eliminate 99 per cent of all tariffs and open up the public procurement and services markets.\n\nWith the ongoing US-China trade tensions, FDI is expected to continue to flow into Vietnam as global businesses seek alternative low-cost manufacturing destinations.

Standard Chartered Bank forecasts Vietnam is likely to enjoy robust growth in the near term, with its GDP projected to be close to 7 per cent.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Trade20 Index examined 66 economies across the globe and determined each market\u2019s potential for trade growth by analyzing changes across three equally weighted pillars: economic dynamism, trade readiness, and export diversity.\n\nWhile most traditional trade indices are based on a market\u2019s present performance, the study captures changes over time to reveal the markets that have seen the most improvement in the past decade.

Many existing FDI projects also increased their investment capital, taking the grand total to $15.7 billion so far this year.\n\nProfessor Tran Anh Tuan, a member of the Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly\u2019s Economic Commission, shared with Vietnam Investment Review, a local media about how to attract more foreign investment into the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, the registered investment capital is not really as important as the working capital that has already been disbursed. In the first nine months of 2019, the implementation capital was some $14.2 billion, an increase of 7.3 per cent against the investment plan. In the same period under review, foreign investors invested $10.4 billion to buy shares in Vietnamese enterprises\u201d. Tuan said.\n\nRelated: Company formation in Vietnam\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Vietnam attracted $36.4 billion in FDI, yet the working capital was only $19 billion. Vietnam\u2019s current FDI policy is totally in line with the Party Central Committee\u2019s direction.\n\nIn 2018, the country attracted $36.4 billion in FDI projects, yet in 2019 the target we set was $30 billion. In other words, the target is some $6.4 billion less. However, the implementation capital set for 2019 was $18.2 billion \u2013 just $900 million lower than that achieved in 2018. In the first nine months, a total of $14.2 billion was disbursed. Based on this, in 2019 Vietnam\u2019s FDI projects and their capital disbursement are likely to surpass the plan.\n\nIn 2020, Vietnam is in a good position to increase the number of FDI projects as well as their capital investment and disbursement capital, but the Government has only set targets of $35-36 billion in FDI capital investment and $19 billion in disbursement. These targets are in line with what was laid down in the Party Central Committee\u2019s Decree 50, meaning Vietnam should focus on the quality, effectiveness, technology and environmental protection of projects before granting licenses for them to operate in the country.\u201d\n\nTalking about advantages in attracting FDI projects, he said that, besides our traditional advantages like the abundant labor force, low labour cost, the country\u2019s population of almost 97 million people, Vietnam has signed 13 free trade agreements (FTAs) with foreign countries, including two FTAs belong to the new generation \u2013 the CPTPP and EVFTA. Besides, the Vietnamese investment and business climate have continued to improve. In addition, Vietnam has three more following advantages:\n\nFirst, the trade war between major economies, particularly the trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nSecond, Decree 50 has laid down specific orientations, objectives, tasks and solutions to attract FDI. Decree 50 has also set out clear objectives to attract more FDI projects, particularly in major projects, national projects and others.\n\nThird, at the recent World Economic Forum, Vietnam\u2019s Global Comparative Index (GCI) jumped 10 places to 67/141 economies. This is a very important index that FDI enterprises look at before they make a decision to invest in Vietnam.\n\nRegarding what Vietnam should do to encourage FDI enterprises to remain in the country, Tuan said, the decree No. 50 confirms that the foreign invested economy is part and parcel of the Vietnamese economy. The Vietnamese Government will provide favorable conditions for FDI enterprises to stay in the country and to compete with other sectors.\n\nAnother very important factor is the development of the Vietnamese industrial support sector. This is considered pivotal for FDI enterprises to decide whether to remain or leave Vietnam.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "link": "https://vietnaminsider.vn/vietnam-welcomes-high-quality-fdi-enterprises/", "published": "2019-10-17T00:37:59+00:00"}, {"title": "Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City is well-positioned to develop into a global financial centre", "text": "The Ho Chi Minh City Economic Forum was opened on October 18 with the theme: \u201cDeveloping Ho Chi Minh City into a global financial centre\u201d, drawing the participation of more than 800 domestic and international experts.\n\nThe aim of the Ho CHi Minh City Economic Forum was to whip up capital support for the construction of a plan to develop Ho Chi Minh City into a global financial centre.\n\nThis plan was assigned by Ho Chi Minh City Finance and Investment State-owned Company and Fulbright School of Public Policy and Management (Fulbright).\n\nTalking at the opening of the forum, Ho Chi Minh City Chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong expected that the plan to develop Ho Chi Minh City into a global financial centre will become a key national project.\n\n\u201cBecoming a global and regional financial centre is key to bringing Ho Chi Minh City to a new level of economic and social development,\u201d Phong said.\n\nAccording to Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, currently being the biggest financial hub of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City has high potential to become a global financial centre.\n\nLooking back at the past 30 yers of renovation, Dam said Vietnam has maintained a steady pace of development and has always been among the fastest-growing countries in the world.\n\nVietnam has been reporting growth rates of 6-8 per cent during the last 10 years. In the next ten years, Dam said, the country aims to grow by more than 7 per cent annually.\n\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung added that the impacts of becoming a global financial centre must be shared with the entire country.\n\n\u201cWith its great geographical location of Vietnam, its economic flagship Ho Chi Minh City is well-positioned to develop into a global financial centre,\u201d Dung added.\n\nSetting up a global financial centre is not only a modern economic trend, but also a proof of an active nation which is ready to develop and integrate with the globe, he added.\n\nWhile the global financial centre is still under construction, Dung boasted that its institution system will be more competitive than other markets in the region.\n\nVietnam has many advantages to develop Ho Chi Minh City into a global financial centre, including stable GDP, strong foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, as well as the government and local authorities\u2019 efforts to renovate and improve the business environment.\n\nAccording to Dung, the key factors that make Ho Chi Minh City especially suitable to become a global financial centre are a competitive market, qualified human resources, standard infrastructure system, and good foundation for financial services.\n\nMoreover, Vietnam is in a time zone different from the 21 biggest financial centres in the world. This is an opportunity for Ho Chi Minh City because investors can do business in Ho Chi Minh City even when other financial centres are closed.\n\nIn addition, Ho Chi Minh City is now conveniently accessible from other regional financial centres. Its Tan Son Nhat airport now serves flights to 72 cities of 25 countries.\n\n\u201cWith the determination and support from the government and local authorities, the business community, and international organisations, we believe that in the near future, the idea of having a global financial centre in Ho Chi Minh City will be realised,\u201d Dung said.\n\nAccording to doctor Tran Du Lich, member of the Prime Minister\u2019s economic advisory group, during the last 20 years, Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s authorities have been focusing on the development of the financial market. In reality, however, development has not been as fast as expected, therefore the city will still need a long time to become a global financial centre.\n\n\u201cTurning this potential, advantages, and ambition into reality is a big issue not only for Ho Chi Minh City but for the whole country as well,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, there is always a first step to starting this long journey. If we don\u2019t start, we will never arrive,\u201d Lich added.\n\nBy Bich Ngoc @ VIR\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "link": "https://vietnaminsider.vn/vietnams-ho-chi-minh-city-is-well-positioned-to-develop-into-a-global-financial-centre/", "published": "2019-10-19T08:33:15+00:00"}, {"title": "Five countries in South Asia and SEA with the best prospects for online micro consumer lending", "text": "According to the analysts of the financial holding Robocash Group who made a corporate ranking of countries in South and Southeast Asia, Laos, India, the Philippines, Myanmar and Vietnam have the highest prospects for the development of online micro consumer lending.\n\nThe highest score in the ranking (20) belongs to Laos. It combines a high potential of the untapped demand with a positive attitude to short-term online lending from the government and population. The need for relevant products in Laos is similar to the situation in Myanmar, but it is free from some obstacles of the latter. Over time, the new market will grow, and foreign investors may significantly contribute to this process. The underdevelopment of the legislation and the absence of financial institutes such as credit bureaus encourage experienced foreign companies with a fine-tuned scoring and reliable operation processes to support the efficient development of the market.\n\nIndia holds second place with a score of 18. Despite a direct connection between the development level of a country and its place in the ranking, India is an exception. Although a significant part of local people already has access to credit products (79.9%), the rest include hundreds of millions of people. It correlates with the formed regulation. Besides, the market has a relatively small number of foreign companies, and not many Chinese startups have entered the market. As a result, the competition remains quite moderate.\n\nThird place belongs to the Philippines (16). The country gives in the leading positions to other countries because of their hidden potential. However, other advantages compensate for it. The country has an established market of short-term lending services, flexible and facilitative regulation. Then, there is a balance between the high demand for relevant products and low debt load among the population. Moreover, the Philippine government is driving the digitization of financial services to decrease the factor of geographical fragmentation. It makes the country stand out on the regional background.\n\nMyanmar is fourth in the ranking (14). As a country with a relatively large number of people below the poverty line and high demand for micro consumer loans, Myanmar stands out in comparison to the more developed countries in Southeast Asia. Still, some points are holding the market back. Partly, this is due to its underdevelopment. The government has introduced strong regulation to get rid off illegal creditors, which activities have led to debt overload of the population. The latter reduces the attractiveness of the country for foreign companies significantly.\n\nFifth place belongs to Vietnam (12). Vietnam demonstrates significant demand for micro consumer online loans. With a large number of people living in rural areas (66%), only one-third of the population has access to credit products. Another stimulating factor is the growing GDP forecasted to increase by 6.6% by 2020. Still, Vietnam should improve its regulation in terms of licensing of companies and control of financial statements. Overall, the country represents a bright example of the market with a medium position in the ranking. Vietnam is quite perspective but gives in the leadership due to the current difficulties for the business.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo rank the countries by their prospects for the development of micro consumer online lending, the estimate took into account the information about GDP, population and its access to financial services, regulation requirements and some other additional factors.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "link": "https://vietnaminsider.vn/five-countries-in-south-asia-and-sea-with-the-best-prospects-for-online-micro-consumer-lending/", "published": "2019-10-19T00:55:08+00:00"}, {"title": "Hanoi water supplier evaded responsibility for contaminated tap water crisis", "text": "The water supplier at the heart of the oil contamination crisis is playing innocent and evading its responsibility for dubious actions and statements.\n\nAfter a million residents of the capital city had to suffer supply of toxic, smelly tap water and spend money on using bottled water instead, the supplier said it was the \u201cbiggest victim\u201d in the incident.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, questions were raised about the responsibility of Vinaconex Water Supply Joint Stock Company (Viwasupco), which supplies potable water to 250,000 families in 10 districts in southwestern Hanoi. The company had continued to supply water even after knowing of oil contamination at the source.\n\nAsked if the company has had plans to compensate those affected by the polluted water, its deputy CEO Bui Dang Khoa said: \u201cViwasupco is the biggest victim in this case and the company hopes the police will soon find true culprit.\u201d\n\nHe also said that as the case was being investigated, \u201call decisions related to the interest of Hanoi\u2019s citizens must wait for the investigation\u2019s results.\u201d\n\nLocal officials differed.\n\nNguyen Khac Long, head of the environment department in Hoa Binh, a neighboring province of the capital city that is home to the water source that Viwasupco takes for processing, said that the department has already collected water and oil samples in affected areas for analysis, and will release the results in a few more days.\n\nLong said the company\u2019s fully responsible for checking the water quality and making sure that it is safe before supplying it.\n\nThe company had not only continued to supply contaminated water, but it responded to residents\u2019 complaints about the smell saying, it could be extra chlorine used to neutralize pollution. An official even said that whether or not the water was smelly was a subjective thing that depended on the individual.\n\nPolice in Hoa Binh have launched a criminal investigation into the dumping of used oil upstream the Da River and are looking to press charges of causing environmental pollution against the perpetrator.\n\nOn Tuesday last week, a 2.5 ton truck was seen dumping used oil into a mountain creek in Phu Minh Commune. The oil spread contaminated the Tram Stream and then the Dam Bai Lake.\n\nTwo days later, Hanoi residents detected an unpleasant, pungent odor in their tap water. Tests of the smelly water by authorities later found that the level of styrene, an organic compound that is probably carcinogenic, was 1.3-3.6 times higher than normal.\n\nHanoi authorities then warned residents that they should not use the water for drinking or cooking, only for other purposes like washing clothes and bathing.\n\nViwasupco currently supplies 300,000 cubic meters of water per day. Around one million people or one eighth of the capital city\u2019s residents depend on its supply.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Hoa Binh authorities suggested that Viwasupco should invest in a closed pipeline system to lead water from the Da River to its tanks.\n\nViwasupco has been taking water directly to its plant from the Dam Bai Lake in the province\u2019s Ky Son District. Provincial authorities said this was not safe because the lake, a natural one, was way too big, spreading 69 hectares (170 acres) and having a wide basin of 16 square kilometers (6.2 square miles).\n\nLying near upstream Da River, it receives water from different sources, including streams and mountain creeks, making it difficult to guarantee safety and monitor the water quality.\n\nLike other water treatment plants in the country, including the biggest one that supplies water to Ho Chi Minh City, a closed pipeline system would take water from the middle level of rivers to avoid trash and in some cases, oil on the surface of the water.\n\nViwasupco should also have stricter solutions to ensure safety of the source of its water and prepare itself for possible problems in the future by envisaging various scenarios and developing an incident response process.\n\nIn case the company fails to ensure the quality of water at the source, it has to stop the entire process and report to the authorities from central to local levels, provincial officials said.\n\nAlso Thursday, Hanoi officials said the latest tap water samples have passed safety tests, but continued to advise against drinking or cooking with it.\n\nNguyen Nhat Cam, director of the Hanoi Center for Disease Control under Hanoi\u2019s Department of Health, said all eight tap water samples collected Monday met safety standards for all 107 parametric values including styrene, a carcinogenic that had been found in excessive quantities in supplies to southwestern Hanoi.\n\n\u201cAll values are within allowed limits. However the samples were collected three days ago, so we still recommend that people do not use the water supplied by the Da River water plant from Wednesday night for drinking or cooking,\u201d he said, adding that the city had instructed the company to resume water supply so people could clean their water tanks.\n\nSource: VnExpress\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "link": "https://vietnaminsider.vn/hanoi-water-supplier-evaded-responsibility-for-contaminated-tap-water-crisis/", "published": "2019-10-18T09:08:33+00:00"}, {"title": "Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s credit growth is slowing", "text": "Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s credit growth is slowing and can fall behind the central bank\u2019s target of 14 per cent for 2019, causing concerns that it could make it difficult for businesses to access bank loans during the remaining months of the year.\n\nAccording to the State Bank of Vi\u1ec7t Nam (SBV), as of September 24, credit growth had expanded 8.64 per cent compared to the end of 2018. The rate was the lowest increase in recent years, even lower than the 9.52 per cent rise during the same period in 2018.\n\nIn the SBV\u2019s September survey on business trends at credit institutions, many credit institutions also forecast that 2019 credit growth would increase by 13.61 per cent this year, lower than the central bank\u2019s 14 per cent target.\n\nGrowth has been slow in recent months. At the end of June, credit had increased by 7.33 per cent. The figure only inched up to 7.48 per cent by the end of July, then to 8 per cent at the end of August.\n\nThis seems to contradict lending reports from some banks which say they have nearly hit their credit growth quotas set by the central bank.\n\nThe central bank has also approved an increase to the credit growth limit in 2019 for banks that have met Basel II standards, such as ACB (13 per cent to 17 per cent), VPBank (12 per cent to 16 per cent), Techcombank (13 per cent to 17 per cent) and MBBank (13 per cent to 17 per cent).\n\nHowever, the banks, which posted the highest credit growth in the first half of the year were mainly small- and medium-sized.\n\nCredit growth at large banks, especially BIDV and VietinBank which account for nearly 25 per cent of outstanding loans in the entire banking system, was very low. VietinBank, for example, witnessed its credit increase by only 2.38 per cent in the first six months of 2019.\n\nThe reason why State-owned commercial banks cannot boost credit growth is that their capital adequacy ratio was close to the minimum threshold set by the SBV while they were unable to raise capital.\n\nThe credit slowdown was also due to banks\u2019 plans to restructure their balance sheets. Instead of raising credit growth as in previous years, many banks have been forced to reduce credit scale to meet the central bank\u2019s Basel II standards.\n\nThis cut to credit supply has made many people worried, especially businesses. However, experts say banks are only tightening credit with highly risky industries and sectors, such as real estate.\n\nNguy\u1ec5n Qu\u1ed1c H\u00f9ng, director of the SBV\u2019s Credit Department, said that bank loans for the Government\u2019s priority sectors had still increased significantly, of which credit for high-tech applicable firms increased by 22.04 per cent; exports, 13.2 per cent; and small- and medium-sized enterprises, 11.42 per cent.\n\nDespite the credit slowdown, the country\u2019s GDP growth hit a nine-year high of 6.98 per cent in the first nine months of the year. It was a positive signal as the credit slowdown did not hit economic growth, meaning the economy has become less dependent on bank credit and relying more on other channels such as the securities and corporate bond markets.\n\nSource: Vietnamnews\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "link": "https://vietnaminsider.vn/viet-nams-credit-growth-is-slowing/", "published": "2019-10-16T08:16:35+00:00"}, {"title": "VIB\u2019s profit after-tax reached VND2,332 billion in the first 9 months of 2019", "text": "Vietnam International Bank (VIB) today announced its business results for the first nine months of 2019.

The punishment must fit the crime and that\u2019s why we introduced this new legislation to cancel visitor visas when a passenger commits a significant biosecurity breach or repeatedly contravenes our biosecurity laws. Returning Australians who do the same could face criminal prosecution or civil court action. They could be ordered to pay up to $420,000 and be sentenced up to 10 years in jail. This government is serious about biosecurity and we will keep working to ensure the measures we have in place safeguard Australia from deadly pests and diseases now and into the future.\u201d\n\nThe introduction of visitor visa cancellations is in addition to a range of measures in place to support Australia\u2019s airport biosecurity. In response to the spread of ASF, heightened screening for banned imported pork products has been implemented at the border.

Opengovasia reported.\n\nAccording to a press release, smart cities and integration based on sensor collection and the analysis of data could drive economic, environmental, and social growth in the country.\n\nTechnology solutions can optimise traffic flows in real-time, reduce energy consumption, and automate waste management.\n\nHowever, despite these benefits, major cities like Ha Noi and HCM City, are facing challenges when it comes to deployment due to city-specific requirements and the need for new policies and regulations from the government and relevant sectors.\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nAt the Industry 4.0 summit held earlier, the Deputy Chairman of HCM said the city has been building its smart city project for two years.\n\nHe noted that every smart city is different. And HCM should conduct a smart city project suited to the characteristics of it because the application of industry 4.0 will solve city-specific problems.\n\nHowever, to develop it, he said the city would need an information centre that enables interactions among local authorities, businesses, and people. In which, the State and businesses would be able to use each other\u2019s data, while people could share knowledge and ideas. These interactions must be digital.\n\nTo facilitate this, the government should build a legal corridor for data management.\n\nThe Deputy Chairman also proposed the government set up a smart city architectural blueprint for all cities and provinces nationwide, ensuring synchronisation.\n\nHa Noi city\n\nAccording to the Deputy Chairman of the Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee, the city has started building an e-government and smart city.\n\nIt has achieved initial results from the construction of information infrastructure, applying corporate information, State management, and residential data. It is moving towards a smart city model, including smart transport.\n\nHe said that Ha Noi lacks smart city standards. The Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has developed this content, but it is not yet completed. It should be issued as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding information application, he wanted the government to build software for localities from the central to the grassroots level.\n\nIt would be wasteful if each locality researched and developed its own software, as it would cause issues in integration and connectivity. He recommended the corporate management software of the Ministry of Planning and Investment and software to manage drugstore and pharmacies of the Ministry of Health.\n\nTechnology solutions are one part of the smart city programme. The city is facing a shortage of skilled human resources.\n\nThe general trend of qualified IT staff is moving to work for non-State enterprises, which pay a higher salary.\n\nThe Deputy Chairman said the State should have special policies to encourage IT staff to work for the State management agencies, building e-government and smart cities.\n\nAccording to MIC, smart cities are a driving force for the socio-economic development across the country. Vietnam has over 830 urban areas with an urbanisation rate of 38.6%.\n\nEconomic growth in urban areas averages 12-15%, 1.5-2 times higher than the national average. About 30 cities and provinces nationwide have implemented smart urban construction projects.\n\nHowever, according to MIC the current development of smart cities is still inadequate. Some localities have started deploying some basic applications and services for smart cities. Also, ministries and agencies continue to research and complete building guidelines, mechanisms, and policies for smart cities.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "link":

retiring, you would probably have encountered problems sending money abroad.\n\nToday, new generation banks or online services dedicated to wealth management make it possible to send money abroad with very low fees. Nevertheless, most of those services are not yet available in Vietnam.\n\nInternational Transfer: How Much Does it Cost?\n\nThese online money transfer services often use trading algorithms, real time Forex transactions, and talented engineers to reduce all the prices of international wire. From a user perspective they are considered very intuitive interfaces and simplified processes that save time and money. Therefore, it is possible to handle an international transfer from USA, Australia, UK, Europe, etc. to Vietnam, Thailand or South America in a few clicks, at a cost of less than 1% for the entire operation. Those services use technologies that guarantee a very competitive exchange rate and ensure an international transfer within a few days.\n\nHere is an international transfer from France to Vietnam. The money has been received and the exchange rate has been guaranteed by the online service Transferwise, which allows the user to send money internationally at very competitive rates. We can see that for 30,000 \u20ac sent to Vietnam, the total cost was only 126 \u20ac. That\u2019s less than 0.5% in fees. Knowing that some banks are getting higher fees to handle such operation, it is convenient that new solutions like these finally exist for expats. If you are an expatriate living in Vietnam, using services like this will save you time and money.\n\nExpatriation, Investment and Business Creation\n\nAs an expatriate it\u2019s wise to make investments in the country where you live for several years. Using foreign capital to invest, launching a business or buying an apartment are very popular methods of investing among the expat community.\n\nSome problems may occur when it comes to selling your business, apartment, and sending the money to a foreign bank account. In most cases, people will have to provide paperwork citing the origin of the money, and show that taxes have been paid. Even if this money has been declared and taxes have been honored, some banks may still ask more questions or provide you with a bad conversion rate. It can be an endless issue that can cause a lot of struggles for expatriates who wish to leave the country.\n\nGetting Money out of Vietnam: What to Do ?\n\nExpat forums in Vietnam are flooded with messages like \u201chow to send money to Europe, USA, Australia from Vietnam\u201c. Digging into this topic highlights the usual alternatives expats are choosing to send money abroad from a Vietnamese bank account. Some of the banks or money services expats use are :\n\nPaypal : An online portfolio to manage money, buy goods online and send money abroad.\n\nWestern Union: An international company with offices in most countries that allows anyone to send cash money orders anywhere in the world.\n\nIndependent broker : Individuals or companies providing international wire and currency exchange.\n\nThe study conducted on Movetoasia.com showed that all these options charge fees ranging from 6% to 10% of the respective transactions. Losing 6 to 10 percent of your assets in exchange rates, processing fees, miscellaneous international transfer fees is not favorable to the majority of expatriates who wish to send several thousand USD or EUR abroad.\n\nMillennials Sending Money from Vietnam\n\nMillennials are always willing to try new alternatives or develop their own methods of handling their money based on what they learn. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is used under its full potential. It is legal in Vietnam for trading and holding Bitcoin. Nevertheless this cryptocurrency is right now illegal as a payment tool. However, it does offer an alternative to international money transfers. The process requires a user to open an account on the regulated exchange in Vietnam, convert their currency, buy Bitcoin and transfer it to another exchange such as Coinbase, which is regulated in Europe, USA, UK, Australia etc.\n\nThus, sending $10,000 from Vietnam to USA will require about 3,5% of total costs. Comparing this method to the 10% of costs that some independent brokers are offering, the savings are huge.\n\nClick here to try the tool to simulate your money transfer\n\nIf you want to go further and find out the exact costs of sending money abroad from Vietnam, Movetoasia.com has a research study which includes the interactive tools to simulate your international transfer updated in real-time.
